Interested in a career in a profession respected for integrity and ethics where you routinely face new challenges, engage in life-long learning, work in dynamic teams, and have in demand skills? Consider accounting! The accounting profession is in an exciting time of evolution with automation, data analytics, remote work, as well as the “usual” changes in financial reporting and tax regulations. It is no longer true that accountants sit in the back room working by themselves.  Accountants fill key roles on teams as business partners and financial experts in consulting, professional services, public accounting, companies of all sizes, startups, nonprofit organizations and all levels of government. A Bachelor of Science in Business Administration with a major in Accounting from LeBow empowers you with a solid foundation in accounting and tax principles, analysis and communication skills, and the ability to collaborate to solve complex issues. Many students enrolling in the Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (BSBA) degree with a major in Accounting are interested in becoming a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) or Certified Management Accountant (CMA). Licensing for the CMA certification is administered by the Institute of Management Accountants (IMA) and is not dependent on state/jurisdiction. Certification eligibility criteria consist of prerequisite requirements including work experience, educational requirements, and the CMA exam. The required curriculum for the BSBA with a major in Accounting meet the education requirements to earn a CMA license. For more information, please see the IMA’s CMA Certification requirements . The requirements for becoming a certified public accountant (CPA) vary by state but generally include completing 150 semester (225 quarter) credit hours in an accounting program at a college or university, passing the CPA exam, and a specific amount of relevant work experience. This NASBA resource provides links to each of the state boards of accountancy to learn more about the specific requirements for your state. The required curriculum for the BSBA with a major in Accounting by itself does not meet the education requirements to earn a CPA license. The LeBow College of Business offers courses that may allow an individual to meet the education requirements to earn a CPA license. Students planning to obtain a CPA license should consult with their academic advisor and the Department of Accounting upon declaring the major to ensure ample time to fulfill such requirements. Please Note: No more than 2 courses or 8.0 credits can be counted towards any additional major/minor/co-major or certificate in the BSBA program.

        "About the Program": "Major: Architectural Studies Degree Awarded: Bachelor of Science (BS) Calendar Type: Quarter Minimum Required Credits: 181.0 Co-op Options: No Co-op (Four years); One Co-op (Four years) Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) code: 04.0803 Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) code: 25-1031 About the Program The Bachelor of Science in Architectural Studies degree offers an introduction to architecture while affording students the flexibility to customize their studies based on their interest in the realm of design and the built environment. The program encompasses foundation courses in the applied and social sciences, the humanities, and a range of architecture courses to give students an understanding of the discipline. At the heart of the curriculum are the introductory-level design studios where students are challenged to apply their knowledge acquired from the above disciplines to consequential design problems. As an art, a technical craft, and an ethical practice, architecture is the culturally responsible design and production of buildings that are functional, sustainable, inspiring, and responsive to their physical and social contexts. Students have the opportunity to reinforce their skills in the field by opting to participate in Drexel’s signature co-op program. This gives students the opportunity to work full-time in an architecture or design firm or related fields either locally, nationally, or internationally. The BS in Architectural Studies program prepares students for entry-level employment in architecture and in related fields. This degree is offered as a co-op and a non-co-op option. The degree modality is face-to-face; however, a small number of classes may be offered partially or fully in a virtual format. This allows us to attract talented experts from outside the greater Philadelphia area and provides more flexibility for students on coop or out working in the profession. The Bachelor of Science in Architectural Studies is not NAAB accredited and does not directly prepare for architectural licensure and registration. The pre-professional BS in Architectural Studies degree offers a foundation in the field of architecture as preparation for continued education in a professional NAAB-accredited graduate degree program. It is also the ideal foundation for specialization in other related disciplines such as Design Research, Urban Strategies, Interior Architecture & Design, Construction Management, Real Estate Development, and Digital Media & Animation, as well as pursuing an individualized path with coursework in other design disciplines within Westphal College. Five(5)-year accelerated BS/MS degree options are available to select students between the following disciplines: BS in Architectural Studies and the MS in Design Research BS in Architectural Studies and the MS in Interior Architecture BS in Architectural Studies and the MS in Urban Strategy . Note: Bachelor of Architecture vs Bachelor of Science in Architectural Studies and Architecture vs Architectural Engineering Because Drexel University offers three programs with \"architecture\" in their titles, it is useful to point out the significant differences between them: Architects design buildings to meet people's spatial, organizational, and aesthetic needs; they also coordinate the building design process. All states, the District of Columbia, and three U.S. territories (Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) require individuals to be licensed (registered) before they may call themselves architects or be contracted to provide architectural services. Many architecture school graduates work in the field even though they are not licensed or while they are in the process of becoming licensed, but they may not call themselves an architect. A licensed architect is required to take legal responsibility for all work. Licensure requirements usually include: A professional degree in architecture (B.Arch. or M.Arch. degrees) A period of practical training or internship (AXP) Passage of all divisions of the Architect Registration Examination (ARE) Architectural Engineers specialize in the design of engineering systems within buildings. Architectural engineers earn Bachelor of Science degrees and become professional engineers with the required experience and state examinations. Students whose interests are focused on the technological and engineering aspects of buildings should review Drexel's major in Architectural Engineering offered by the College of Engineering. The difference between the NAAB-accredited Bachelor of Architecture (B.Arch.) degree and the non-accredited Bachelor of Science in Architectural Studies (BS in Arch. Studies) degree: Bachelor of Architecture (B.Arch.) degrees are designed to help you develop a comprehensive knowledge of the discipline of architecture, as well as foundational professional knowledge and a basic understanding of related fields. The NAAB-accredited B.Arch. degree at Drexel University is suitable for students who seek to earn a professional undergraduate degree that leads to professional licensure and affords them early exposure to architectural practice. While our B.Arch. degree does NOT participate in Drexel's signature co-op program, our students' opportunity to gain professional work experience and complete most or all of their AXP requirements prior to graduation far exceeds the practice exposure of co-op. A conventional B.Arch. degree is typically five years long. The 2+4 Option and the PT Evening Option take longer to complete due to the part-time model but allows an accelerated path to professional licensure due to parallel AXP completion and the option to participate in IPAL. The Bachelor of Science in Architectural Studies (BS in Arch. Studies) degree is a four-year, pre-professional degree that is NOT accredited by NAAB. You will develop a comprehensive knowledge of the discipline of architecture, hone your design skills, and expand your architectural understanding. If you’re unsure about becoming a licensed architect, this degree provides flexible avenues to combine your studies with related fields. Our BS in Architectural Studies degree can be a precursor to a dual BS/MS degree at Drexel University or a professional NAAB-accredited M.Arch. degree.

        "About the Program": "Major: Architecture Degree Awarded: Bachelor of Architecture (BArch) Calendar Type: Quarter Minimum Required Credits: 227.0 Co-op Options: None Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) code: 04.0902 Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) code: 17-1011 About the Program The practice of architecture requires a unique skillset—creative thinking and aesthetic sensitivity balanced with technical knowledge, cultural understanding, and social responsibility. Critical thinking and communication skills are needed. Drexel’s Bachelor of Architecture program encompasses foundation courses in the applied and social sciences, the humanities, and a wide range of professional architecture courses to prepare students for careers in architecture and related fields. At the heart of the curriculum are the design studios where students are challenged to apply their knowledge acquired from the above disciplines to consequential design problems. Drexel’s work/study program is an experiential-based learning model that complements and provides an alternative to traditional full-time academic architecture programs. The Drexel model provides a practical, high-quality education to those students who seek early exposure to daily architectural practice as well as an affordable alternative to students who could not otherwise be able to enter the profession. At Drexel there are two paths to an accredited Bachelor of Architecture degree, serving two distinct populations: the 2+4 option and the part-time evening option. Accreditation In the United States, most registration boards require a degree from an accredited professional degree program as a prerequisite for licensure. The National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB), which is the sole agency authorized to accredit US professional degree programs in architecture, recognizes three types of degrees: the Bachelor of Architecture, the Master of Architecture, and the Doctor of Architecture. A program may be granted an eight-year, three-year, or two-year term of accreditation, depending on the extent of its conformance with established educational standards. Doctor of Architecture and Master of Architecture programs may require a pre-professional undergraduate degree in architecture for admission; however, the pre-professional degree is not, by itself, recognized as an accredited degree. Drexel University, Antoinette Westphal College of Media Arts & Design, Department of Architecture, Design & Urbanism offers the following NAAB-accredited degree program(s): 2+4 Option:                                          6-year program (2 years full-time, 4 years part-time) Bachelor of Architecture 227.0 undergraduate quarter-term credits Part-Time Evening Option:                  7-year part-time program Bachelor of Architecture 227.0 undergraduate quarter-term credits Next accreditation visit for both tracks: 2026 About the 2+4 Option The 2+4 option is suitable for well-prepared students entering the Bachelor of Architecture degree directly after graduating from high school. In this program, two years of full-time coursework address the basic principles of architectural design and satisfy fundamental Drexel University core requirements in the arts and sciences as well as those job-related skills that are needed for entry-level professional positions in architecture or related fields. A comprehensive review of performance will take place after each year to ensure that students are making sufficient progress in all areas. At the end of the sophomore year, a more thorough review of performance and advancement will be conducted to decide if the student is ready to move into the next phase of the accredited degree program in architecture. After successfully completing the minimum requirements of the full-time phase of Studio 2 and the co-requisite curriculum for that level, students are supported to find full-time employment in the building industry, including architecture firms, while continuing their academic program part-time in the evening for four additional years. About the Part-time Evening Option The part-time evening option is one of only two part-time evening architectural programs in the United States leading to the NAAB-accredited Bachelor of Architecture degree. Designed for non-traditional and transfer students, this program offers all courses part-time in the evening, enabling students to work full-time. The evening program sequence is seven years, but transfer students with university-level design credits can reduce its length by meeting specific program requirements through transcript and portfolio review. After completion of Studio 2 and the co-requisite curriculum for that level, a more thorough review of performance and advancement will be conducted to decide if the student is ready to advance further within the accredited degree program in architecture. The degree modality of the B. Arch. degree is face-to-face for both tracks; however, a small number of classes may be offered partially or fully in a virtual format. This allows us to attract talented experts from outside the greater Philadelphia area and provides more flexibility for students out working in the profession or commuting to Drexel. By combining work and study, all Drexel Architecture students may be able to simultaneously satisfy their required internship for licensure—now called the Architectural Experience Program (AXP)— while completing their professional degree, thus qualifying for the registration exam on graduation in most jurisdictions. The Integrated Path to Architectural Licensure (IPAL) Program In August of 2015, Drexel was approved by the National Council of Architectural Registration Boards (NCARB) for participation in the Integrated Path to Architectural Licensure (IPAL) Program. IPAL provides students the opportunity to achieve licensure upon graduation—an important innovation affording students the chance to jump-start their careers through a curriculum of education, work experience, and licensure examinations. Students follow either of the two options leading to the Bachelor of Architecture degree while preparing for and sitting for licensing exams during the summers following the third, fourth, and fifth year of study. Drexel is part of a selective group of schools in the country to offer this opportunity, an initiative spearheaded by the National Council of Architectural Registration Boards (NCARB), and one of the very few architecture programs offering the IPAL path to students enrolled in an undergraduate BArch degree program. Students seeking access to this track need permission from the program director and the IPAL faculty advisor. Note: Bachelor of Architecture vs Bachelor of Science in Architectural Studies and Architecture vs Architectural Engineering Because Drexel University offers three programs with \"architecture\" in their titles, it is useful to point out the significant differences between them: Architects design buildings to meet people's spatial, organizational, and aesthetic needs. They also coordinate the building design process. All states, the District of Columbia, and three U.S. territories (Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) require individuals to be licensed (registered) before they may call themselves architects or be contracted to provide architectural services. Many architecture school graduates work in the field even though they are not licensed or while they are in the process of becoming licensed. But they may not call themselves an architect. A licensed architect is required to take legal responsibility for all work. Licensure requirements usually include: A professional degree in architecture (B.Arch. or M.Arch. degrees) A period of practical training or internship (AXP) Passage of all divisions of the Architect Registration Examination (ARE) The difference between the NAAB-accredited Bachelor of Architecture (B.Arch.) degree and the non-accredited Bachelor of Science in Architectural Studies (BS in Arch. Studies) degree: Bachelor of Architecture (B.Arch.) degrees are designed to help you develop a comprehensive knowledge of the discipline of architecture, as well as foundational professional knowledge and a basic understanding of related fields. The NAAB-accredited B.Arch. degree at Drexel University is suitable for students who seek to earn a professional undergraduate degree that leads to professional licensure and affords you early exposure to architectural practice. While our B.Arch. degree does NOT participate in Drexel's signature coop program, our students' opportunity to gain professional work experience and complete most or all of their AXP requirements prior to graduation, thus far exceeding the practice exposure of coop. A conventional B.Arch. degree is typically five years long. The 2+4 Option and the PT Evening Option take longer to complete due to the part-time model but allows an accelerated path to professional licensure due to parallel AXP completion and the option to participate in IPAL. The Bachelor of Science in Architectural Studies (BS in Arch. Studies) degree is a four-year, pre-professional degree that is NOT accredited by NAAB. You will develop a comprehensive knowledge of the discipline of architecture, hone your design skills and expand your architectural understanding. If you’re unsure about becoming a licensed architect, this degree will still encompass everything you enjoy about design and construction and gives you a broad introduction to architecture. Further, it provides flexible avenues to combine your studies with related fields. The BS in Arch. Studies degree is offered as a coop and a non-coop option. Our BS. in Architectural Studies degree can be a precursor to a dual BS/MS degree at Drexel University or a professional NAAB-accredited M.Arch. degree. ​ Architectural Engineers specialize in the design of engineering systems within buildings. Architectural engineers earn Bachelor of Science degrees and become professional engineers with the required experience and state examinations. Students whose interests are focused on the technological and engineering aspects of buildings should review Drexel's major in Architectural Engineering offered by the College of Engineering.

The B.Arch. is the first professional degree in architecture that qualifies for professional licensure along with completing the Architectural Experience Program (AXP) and passing the Architectural Registration Exams (ARE). Drexel's architecture graduates often continue working for the firms that employed them during the work-study phase of their studies. In time, some architects reach positions of associate or partner in these offices while others choose to launch their own firms. Other graduates pursue a master degree and specialize in an advanced area of interest - either upon graduation or at a later point. Urban design, sustainability, historic preservation, interior design, and facilities management are some of the related careers that architectural graduates also pursue with similar patterns of success.

Works of fine and applied arts are understood not merely as aesthetic forms, but as expressions of the social, economic, scientific, religious, and political contexts that gave rise to them. The study of art history thus effectively serves the high purposes of a liberal education by equipping students with an understanding of world cultures and their histories from multiple disciplinary perspectives, and by encouraging the development of critical thinking, reading, research, and writing skills. The art history program has a uniquely flexible curricular design in that it permits students to pursue art history as either a Bachelor of Arts or a Bachelor of Science degree. The BA degree is intended for students wishing to become professional art historians or who wish to supplement the art history curriculum with other courses leading to a specific career path. The BS degree is designed to allow students to combine the art history major with another major or to tailor the curriculum to their specific interests and aspirations. Both the BA and BS degrees require a total of 181.0 credit hours. Bachelor of Arts The BA degree requires 60.0 credit hours of art history, 75.0 credit hours of General Education courses, and 46.0 credit hours of Free Electives. The BA degree requires a strong component of Arts and Humanities courses in order to prepare students to enter the professional world of art historians by exposing them to critical reasoning, philosophy, anthropology, literature, world cultures, and foreign languages. The 46.0 credit hours of Free Electives can be used under faculty advisement to take additional art history courses, develop special competencies and areas of interest (e.g., race and gender studies; the histories of technology, science and philosophy; Asian or Africana studies; writing, literature, and criticism; design history; museum studies, etc.), or gain competencies in various applied or technical areas.

Biologists study the structure and functions of living organisms from the individual cell to the full organism, and collectively to the community level. Discoveries in the biological sciences influence many aspects of our daily lives and have become the foundation of many new developments in biotechnology and medicine. In the past two decades, advances in molecular biology, cell biology and genetics have been rapid, opening many new, exciting career opportunities in biotechnology, genetic engineering and the development of new diagnostics and therapeutics. Biologists can pursue a variety of options including careers in medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine or other health-related areas; in research or commercial laboratories at pharmaceutical companies, medical research laboratories, biotechnology companies or in government agencies; and in teaching. In fact, more than 100 different occupations have been listed for biologists. Graduates in the biological sciences are in demand and enjoy a high placement rate with competitive salaries. The curricular choices are designed to provide a sound basis for careers in the private sector, government and research laboratories, and for advanced study in graduate and professional programs in medicine, other health related areas, or in teaching. The course requirements identifies required support courses in chemistry, physics, mathematics, humanities, and social sciences. With proper selection of electives, students can meet teacher certification requirements or complete a minor in another field. Students are encouraged to consult frequently with their academic advisor for curriculum planning. In addition to the core requirements, students select one of six concentrations in a field of interest: Cell/Molecular Biology/Genetics/Biochemistry Organismal Biology/Physiology Ecology/Evolution/Genomics Pathobiology General Biology Cell and Gene Therapy Program Options Co-op employment is an option for biological science students. T hrough Drexel Co-op, biological sciences majors gain on-the-job experience — exploring their career options, strengthening their résumés and building a professional network in the process.

        "About the Program": "About the Department In what ways has the War on Drugs of the 1980s and 1990s continued to impact urban communities in terms of street-corner dealing, violence, and overall health? What are the lasting effects of that \"War\" paradigm as they relate to national incarceration rates, racial disparities in police shootings, stop-and-frisk, and the adjudication process? In what ways are “big data” being used (now and in the future) by justice, intelligence, or private organizations to identify social networks, conduct risk assessments, and make decisions about crime policy and resource deployment? How did Pandemic influence crime and conflict across communities, as well as police practices? These are just some of the questions the Criminology and Justice Studies faculty work every day to answer, both through their research and scholarship, and in the classroom with our students. Drexel University's degree programs in Criminology and Justice Studies offer a rich educational experience that emphasizes justice and criminological theory, the use of analytical tools and data to answer big questions about crime and justice, all while teaching students how to translate conceptual knowledge into state of the art practice. Along the way, the Department of Criminology and Justice Studies offers global educational opportunities with two courses taught abroad, a set of community-based courses that take students beyond the classroom to practice the learning process, as well as an urban educational experience in one of the premier cities in the country. With its flexible curriculum and two minors, one in Justice Studies , the other in Crime Analytics and Digital Investigations , we provide our students with ready opportunities to double major and take more specialized courses of study. We encourage our students to take at least one minor as both a resume booster and a curricular enhancement within our own department. The Department of Criminology and Justice Studies offers students many pathways through which to complete a course of study that emphasizes innovative learning opportunities, global and civic engagement and a culture that fosters student successes and well being. Degree Concentration Criminal Justice Drexel Co-op for Criminology and Justice Studies Majors The Department of Criminology and Justice Studies offers three options for students: a five-year three co-op option, a four-year one co-op option, and a four-year, no co-op option. We help students chose a co-op option that best fits their goals, though we encourage students earning their bachelor's degree in criminology to take advantage of the co-op program. Taking on the 5-year three co-op option means students will have earned a total of one and a half years of work experience by the time they graduate, allowing them to apply for crime and intelligence analysis or other positions that require at least one-year experience ( What is crime analysis? Click here to find out about this exciting career path for our graduates). Criminology and Justice Studies students have held co-op positions at the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office, at local sheriff and police departments, with local judges, at criminal justice agencies, law firms, community agencies and nonprofit organizations locally and justice organizations nationally.

The program is designed for highly motivated students whose academic curiosity and career ambitions cannot be satisfied by a traditional major. Students typically interested in pursuing a Custom-Designed Major are motivated by a particular theme, topic, issue, or problem that can be more holistically addressed by combining multiple disciplines and fields of knowledge. The major offers students the opportunity for an early intensive research experience, incorporates cooperative education as part of its degree requirements (either four years with one co-op, or five years with three co-ops), and culminates in an original, interdisciplinary senior year project. Each student accepted into the program will be advised by the program staff and closely mentored during their senior year by one or more Drexel faculty members with expertise in at least one of the disciplines composing the student's proposed course of study. Students may be admitted by internal or external transfer. Incoming first-year students interested in Custom-Designed Major should apply to the First Year Exploratory Studies (FYES) program; for the students entering FYES with Custom-Designed already in mind as their major, part of their time in FYES will be spent formulating their formal application to the major. Current Drexel students seeking a change of major to Custom-Designed must have final applications submitted by Week One of the summer term preceding their junior year, so that they have a minimum of 5 academic terms in the major prior to graduation. Students do not need to be members of the Honors Program to be eligible to apply to the program.

This program combines rigorous academic coursework with extensive stage and studio dance experiences to prepare students for four possible career paths within dance: dance/movement therapy, dance in education, physical therapy and performance. Students participating in this major will earn a BS degree in dance with an optional minor in psychology. Students focused on dance/movement therapy will prepare for jobs as dance/movement therapists. These are psychological counselors working in a variety of settings including hospitals, out-patient clinics and residential treatment centers. Students pursuing this option will earn a BS degree in dance at the Westphal College, through the Department of Performing Arts, for the first four years of study. They will then have the option to continue on to two years of study in the College of Nursing and Health Professions to earn an MA in Creative Arts in Therapy and become a licensed dance therapist. The second career focus, dance education , prepares students for jobs as elementary school teachers (grades Pre-K through 4) who may also serve as school dance specialists. Students choosing this option will earn a BS degree in dance through the Department of Performing Arts with a license to teach dance through The Pennsylvania Department of Education. Students may elect to continue for a fifth year of study to earn an MS in the Teaching, Learning & Curriculum through the School of Education. The third career focus, physical therapy , prepares students to work as physical therapists in a variety of settings, including hospitals, treatment centers, schools, and private practice. Students interested in the physical therapy option will complete the four-year BS degree in dance, along with a series of recommended electives in the physical sciences. After completion of the BS degree, students will continue their education for an additional three years in the College of Nursing and Health Professions to earn a DPT and become a licensed physical therapist. The fourth option, custom design , allows students to work closely with faculty to create a personalized career in dance. Many students in this focus select performance , which prepares them to work as performers and/or choreographers in a variety of settings. Students interested in the performance option will complete the four-year BS degree in dance, with an emphasis on collaborative and interdisciplinary work. The student who enters the dance major at Drexel University is an academically achieving student who has a deep curiosity for non-traditional careers in the field of dance. He or she is looking for extensive experiences to improve as a dancer, choreographer and performer while being stimulated academically. This student wants to study dance—-both physically and cognitively—in college while being offered the possibility of gainful employment after graduation.

Environmental engineers design systems, processes and policies to minimize the effect of human activities on the physical and living environment so that we can all live more healthy and sustainable lives. Environmental engineers work to meet human needs for resources in ways to minimize impact on the ecosystem and adverse effects on health.  This field builds on other branches of engineering, especially civil, chemical and mechanical engineering. It also builds on information from many of the sciences, such as chemistry, physics, hydrology, geology, atmospheric science and several specializations of biology (ecology, microbiology and biochemistry). Students who elect to study environmental engineering will become familiar with many of these areas because maintaining and improving the environment requires that problems be evaluated and solutions found using a multidisciplinary approach. Mission The mission of the undergraduate environmental engineering program at Drexel University is to graduate outstanding engineers who can identify, evaluate and solve complex environmental problems, and who desire to continue their education on a lifelong basis. Program Educational Objectives Environmental engineering graduates will become professionals who analyze, design, construct, manage or operate facilities or systems to protect or enhance the environment of people and other living things, or advance knowledge of the field. Student Outcomes The department’s student outcomes reflect the skills and abilities that the curriculum is designed to provide to students by the time they graduate. These are: An ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science and mathematics An ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental and economic factors An ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences An ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in  global, economic, environmental and societal contexts An ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks and meet objectives An ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions An ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed while using appropriate learning strategies Additional Information The Environmental Engineering program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, www.abet.org .

        "About the Program": "Major: Game Design and Production Degree Awarded: Bachelor of Science (BS) Calendar Type: Quarter Minimum Required Credits: 191.0 Co-op Options: Three Co-op (Five years); One Co-op (Four years) Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) code: 11.0899 Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) code: 27-1014; 25-1199 About the Program Drexel's Game Design & Production undergraduate major, nationally ranked as a top program for game design by multiple organizations, such as the Princeton Review (ranked #8 in 2024), provides students with a broad foundation in digital design and content creation skills in team project environments. In Drexel’s generalist-to-specialist approach, students experience a wide variety of roles in bringing a game all the way through production – from pie-in-the-sky idea to playable reality. Through this process of discovery, students learn about themselves and the skill focuses that they want to pursue, minors and electives they want to study, and how to create a game as part of a team throughout the program. Drexel’s Game Design & Production program is committed to making the game development environment, and by extension the industry at large, a supportive and welcoming community for all voices. The democratization of game making tools enables anyone to tell their story in this immersive and interactive medium. We in the program are excited to guide and support the next generation of storytellers as they create new works that entertain and reflect upon the full spectrum of the human experience. The major supports careers in every industry that utilizes real-time interactive digital experiences. Our graduates have measurable value to the entertainment sector of computer, mixed-reality, mobile, and console games industries. Beyond entertainment, our graduates are needed in countless industries, anywhere in the world, that utilize interactive digital environments for simulation, training, marketing, communication, or education. Our focus on project-based teamwork prepares students for cross-disciplinary work in any scale at any size of company. From big-budget AAA blockbuster game studios with team sizes in the hundreds with specialist technicians and artists, to small- and medium-sized companies where developers have broad skill bases, to small independent studios – including those founded by our entrepreneurial students. Drexel Dragons can be specialists with a strong foundation that allows them to adapt, to be flexible bridge-builders and liaisons across art and technical teams, and rugged entrepreneurs running their own start-up. Digital content creation is a dynamically evolving industry. Certain processes and jobs that exist today may be automated within five years, with the recent developments in imitative artificial intelligence tools being the latest example. Companies small to large will use established and newly developed commercially available tools, but also build and maintain proprietary in-house tools and pipelines. Courses in Drexel’s program evolve in response to, and in anticipation of, industry trends and on-demand special topic courses are taught to rapidly respond to student and industry developments. Familiarity with the latest industry standard for tools is important but student skills must be transferrable and tool-agnostic – to adapt to a 3D modeling tool like Blender, 3DS Max, Maya, or proprietary in-house tools that are only accessible within the company that develops them. Drexel’s program encourages students to become adept at the core processes of digital creation, not just a single piece of software. Our courses are predominantly offered face-to-face on campus, but we also feature virtual courses taught by a diverse range of experts from across the nation, exposing students to a wide network of active professionals and to the evolving climate of industry work as a significant number of studios have permanently moved to be partially or completely remote, even prior to 2020. Students start building game assets and games in their first terms as freshmen and continue to create team-based game projects both small and large throughout their plan of study. Interdisciplinary teamwork is a core skill developed in teams of two to over eighteen, often spanning multiple programs including Computer Science, Music Industry, Animation & VFX, Digital Media & Virtual Production, User Experience & Interaction Design, and more. Every project enables students to experiment and refine their experience in the numerous roles required to produce a finished game. Drexel University offers multiple opportunities to support the entrepreneurial minded student, from Drexel’s on-campus indie game incubator, the Entrepreneurial Game Studio , to the Close School of Entrepreneurship and the Baiada Institute for Entrepreneurship . Career building begins inside the classroom with team projects and networking, and outside the classroom with six or eighteen months of co-op experiences. To complement the creative focus of the Game Design & Production major, a minor in Computer Science is popular, and in many cases an ideal supplement for our students. The CS minor increases programming knowledge while maintaining a creative design and production focus in the Game Design & Production major. There are more than 120 minors available at Drexel and many are easy to achieve within our plan of study using free electives. It is important for students to make their minor a personal choice to reflect their specific focus and further personalize their Drexel education experience.

A series of required courses in history build skills in research and interpretation of the past while elective courses within and outside the history program allow students to shape their curriculum to meet their needs and interests. Our history graduates go to graduate school in history, to professional schools in law, medicine, and business, and to work in business, government agencies, and non-profit organizations. We apply Drexel's experiential, research-intensive approach to the discipline of history. Using the extensive historical resources of Philadelphia, the region, and the digital world, students develop a profound understanding of history and the ways it is made. We also encourage students to enrich their education through co-op, study abroad, and summer research projects working alongside department faculty. Degree Offered The Bachelor of Arts (BA) provides a course of study that includes a broad grounding in the liberal arts, with the opportunity for students to choose courses to fulfill humanities, social science, foreign language, math and science requirements according to their overall educational and career plans. The program requirements also leave room for students to take electives of interest or to add a minor or a double-major in another course of study. The Minor in History allows students in other majors to explore the historical background of their discipline, to better understand the origins of the contemporary world, and to build the knowledge and skills needed to understand the development of human societies over time and to understand historical episodes into their proper contexts. The minor in History is highly flexible and allows students to choose those History courses which appeal to them and which will contribute to their broader education. To complete the minor, students must take a total of six History courses (24.0 credits), five of which must be at the 200-level or above. The Minor in War and Society is an interdisciplinary minor offered by history in which students examine the history and politics of warfare, the military, and related institutions. In the Minor in the History of Capitalism , students explore capitalism and the emergence of the modern world economy from a global, historical perspective. Drexel Co-op for History majors History majors at Drexel embark on up to three, six-month periods of employment — exploring their career options, strengthening their résumés and building a professional network in the process. Our curriculum has students complete courses in historical methods before they go on co-op, allowing them to hone their research, analytical and communication skills while adding value to their employer.

        "About the Program": "Major: Mechanical Engineering & Mechanics Degree Awarded: Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering (BSME) Calendar Type: Quarter Minimum Required Credits: 190.0 Co-op Options: Three Co-op (Five years); One Co-op (Four years) Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) code: 14.1901 Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) code: 17-2141 About the Program The role of the mechanical engineer in today’s society is rapidly changing. Advances in manufacturing, transportation, infrastructure systems, materials, communications and high-performance computing have introduced new demands, opportunities and challenges for mechanical engineers. What was once an individual endeavor has now become a team activity. Today’s industries require that mechanical engineers possess diverse interdisciplinary skills, a global viewpoint, entrepreneurial and managerial abilities and an understanding of the forces governing the marketplace. Traditionally, mechanical engineers have been associated with industries like automotive, transportation and power generation, and with activities involving the design, analysis, and manufacturing of products useful to society. While today such activities are still dominated by mechanical engineers, the spectrum of opportunities for these professionals has expanded tremendously. For example, mechanical engineers are involved in the design and analysis of biomedical instrumentation, electronic components, smart structures and advanced materials; they are involved in sophisticated studies of human motion, control of satellites, and the development of more efficient energy-transfer techniques. Drexel’s Department of Mechanical Engineering and Mechanics (MEM) prides itself on providing its students with a comprehensive program of courses, laboratories, design projects, and co-op experiences. The MEM curriculum is designed to balance technical breadth (provided by a set of fundamental required core courses) with technical depth (provided by optional concentrations that emphasize particular fields within the profession). Thus, the MEM program not only prepares its graduates to become successful mechanical engineers needed in industry and government, but also provides an excellent springboard to pursue graduate studies in medical sciences, law, business, information technology, and any other disciplines where technological and analytical skills play an important role. Mission Statement The mission of the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Mechanics of Drexel University is to transfer and acquire knowledge through: (a) the education of engineers for leadership in industry, business, academia, and government; and (b) the establishment of internationally recognized research programs.

Program Educational Objectives Our graduates will be successful in careers that deal with the design, simulation, and analysis of engineering systems, experimentation and testing, manufacturing, technical services, and research. Our graduates will enter and complete academic and professional programs in engineering, business, management, law and medicine. Our graduates will communicate effectively with peers and be successful working with and leading multidisciplinary and multicultural teams. Our graduates will recognize the global, legal, societal and ethical contexts of their work. Our graduates will advance in their careers; for example, assuming increasing levels of responsibility and acquiring professional licensure. Student Outcomes The Department’s student outcomes reflect the skills and abilities that the curriculum is designed to provide to students by the time they graduate. These are: An ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science and mathematics An ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental and economic factors An ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences An ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations in global, economic, environmental and societal contexts An ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks and meet objectives An ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions An ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed using appropriate learning strategies Additional Information The Mechanical Engineering and Mechanics program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET .

Two concentrations are offered—Music Industry Business and Recording Arts (MIBU) and Music Production (RAMP)—providing hands-on experience and a strong academic foundation in relevant areas of this rapidly changing industry. The Music Industry curriculum is divided into four areas which are combined with cooperative experience: general education, music core, music industry core, and concentration requirements. In an industry where the process of career building often begins with a few key contacts, the cooperative education program provides Drexel students the opportunity to meet industry professionals and network. The program prepares students for careers in the music industry in such diverse positions as recording engineer, music producer, sound designer, music lawyer, business manager, or music publisher. The co-op experience during the sophomore and junior year summer terms involves full-time, career-related employment during which students gain valuable insight into how the entertainment industry works. About the Concentrations The major offers two concentrations: Music Industry Business and Recording Arts (MIBU) and Music Production (RAMP): The Music Industry Business (MIBU) concentration provides a rigorous academic foundation complemented by a real-world, hands-on, highly intensive business experience. This mission is realized through the students' participation in the MAD Dragon Music Group, a group of student-run enterprises including MAD Dragon Records, MAD Dragon Live, MAD Dragon Publishing, and MAD Dragon Marketing. The Recording Arts and Music Production (RAMP) concentration focuses on the techniques and technologies of music and audio production. As well as providing the technology-oriented student with the necessary skills to perform as an audio engineer or record producer, the concentration teaches students a full range of industry functions including post-production audio, live sound engineering, and music and audio freelancing skills. The concentration encourages the technology student to interact with the students in the business concentration by recording, mixing, and mastering the music for MAD Dragon Music Group projects and engaging in live performance production. All Music Industry students qualify to apply for a minor in Business Administration after completing their Music Industry core requirements. This emphasis on business courses as part of the core requirements is one of the foundations of the program. Special Admissions Considerations Students wishing to be admitted to the Music Industry major must meet or exceed the general requirements for admission to the University and the College of Media Arts and Design. The program no longer accepts hard-copy portfolios; however, when applying to the Music Industry program, applicants are encouraged to use the portfolio portal provided on the Admissions Instructions webpage to upload electronic examples of pertinent activities (music and/or business and entrepreneurial), as well as a resume of music-industry-related experience. In their major-specific essays, applicants should address their reasons for selecting the Music Industry major at Drexel and share their passion for this unique area of study.

About the Program The Nutrition and Foods curriculum emphasizes the relationship between food, food choices, nutrient metabolism and preventive nutrition to meet the health and nutrient needs of individuals and groups. The BS in Nutrition and Foods requires four years of study and the completion of at least 182.0 credits. The curriculum is designed to provide a sound basis for careers in many areas of food, nutrition and dietetics, including wellness and disease prevention, the food industry, food service and clinical practice. The study of the biochemical nature of nutrients and foods, their interaction with the environment and their eventual metabolic fate is also a strong career path for more research-minded students or those going on to graduate school in the health professions. Paths to Becoming a Registered Dietitian/Registered Dietitian Nutritionist The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics is the nation's largest organization of food and nutrition professionals, most of whom are RD/RDNs (Note that the \"RD\" and \"RDN\" credentials are the same credential). Students entering higher education in 2023 to become an RD/RDN can follow one of the following pathways: Didactic Program in Dietetics, Master's Degree and Accredited Dietetic Internship: Completion of a Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD) at either the bachelor's or master's degree level. The DPD includes coursework approved by the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND). Coursework typically includes nutrition and food sciences, chemistry, biochemistry, physiology, microbiology, community nutrition, nutrition counseling, basic and quantity food preparation, food service systems management and medical nutrition therapy. Drexel currently offers a DPD program at the master's degree level.

        "About the Program": "Major: Philosophy Degree Awarded: Bachelor of Arts (BA) Calendar Type: Quarter Minimum Required Credits:  180.0 Co-op Options: Three Co-op (Five years); One Co-op (Four years); No Co-op (Four years) Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) code: 38.0101 Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) code: 25-1126 About the Program A great philosopher once said, \"Philosophers have just interpreted the world—but the point is to change it.\" At Drexel, we believe ideas do affect and change the world—ideas about what matters, what \"success\" means and how to accomplish it, and what is to be learned from our experiences and activity. The most important reason to study philosophy is so we all can change the world and ourselves by living \"the examined life\" and being more reflective, thoughtful, and critical in our lives in concrete ways. Our classes seek to engage students in the active development of their reflective, creative, rational, logical, and linguistic abilities in thoughtful concern for some of the most important and fundamental questions and problems of life, or work, and of the world. The BA in Philosophy introduces the methods of philosophy in the context of engagement and contact with the world and its problems—from the personal to the global to the cosmic. A degree in philosophy prepares students for success in any field that values thoughtful reflection, logical thinking and clear communication about real issues and concerns, but is particularly valuable for careers in law, graduate study in philosophy, or in fields related to philosophy like critical media studies, public policy or science, technology and society (STS). Drexel Philosophy majors take a mixture of historical and topical courses in the major fields of philosophical inquiry. These include ethics, metaphysics (philosophy of reality), epistemology (philosophy of knowledge), aesthetics (philosophy of art), social and political philosophy, philosophy of science, and logic. Our elective classes cover a wide range of subjects including technology, medicine, law, religion, science, the environment, and more. Our upper-level seminar classes are discussion-driven, reading- and writing-intensive classes usually limited to 12-16 students. Concentrations Once students have started in the program, they may choose to focus their philosophical studies in one of three areas of concentration: Ethical Theory and Practice Philosophy and Law Philosophy, Technology, and Science Students may also remain in the General Philosophy concentration, which gives them the widest range of options from which to select their courses. Prior to the end of junior year, students may opt to work on a 6.0 credit senior thesis. This is a faculty-mentored independent research and writing project on a topic developed by the student working with a chosen faculty member. The project consists of two consecutive one-on-one tutorials directed by a faculty member of the student’s choosing. Philosophy students who are interested in pursuing careers in the law or government are encouraged to consider a Kline Law Minor or a minor in some other field of interest. Students considering graduate school in the humanities including philosophy should consider pursuing a language certificate in their chosen language of interest. The philosophy BA includes approximately 60.0 credits of free electives, which also makes it possible for students to double major. Our program also offers a minor in Philosophy (24.0 credits) and certificate programs in Ethical Theory and Practice; Philosophy, Arts, and Humanities; and Philosophy, Science, and Technology (18.0 credits each). Drexel Co-op for Philosophy Majors Through Drexel’s cooperative education program, students embark on up to three, six-month periods of employment, exploring their career options and building a professional network in the process. Philosophy majors are encouraged to seek out interesting co-op opportunities related to potential career options and the skills developed through their philosophical studies. Students interested in ethics have worked for a hospital’s board of institutional review, while those interested in aesthetics and politics have worked with the Philadelphia Mural Arts program in liaison with community groups. There is also a substantial amount of law and research-related co-op opportunities for students interested in pre-law and academia. Additional Information For more information about Drexel Philosophy classes and programs, please visit the Department of English & Philosophy website or stop by to see our director anytime. The Department of English & Philosophy is located in MacAlister Hall, Room 5016.

        "Co-op/Career Opportunities": "Co-op/Career Opportunities Opportunities No major prepares students for success in as wide a variety of careers as philosophy. Because philosophical work helps students develop superior reasoning, communication, and analytical skills, a philosophy major can be an ideal choice for pre-med or pre-law students. It is also particularly valuable as a preparation for graduate study in philosophy and fields related to it, such as critical media studies, public policy, education, and science, technology, and society (STS). The Drexel Philosophy major is an excellent preparation for success in any field of endeavor that values thoughtful reflection, logical thinking, and clear communication. Philosophy majors graduate into a wide range of successful careers in business, industry, law, government, education, and service organizations and agencies, as well as many fields of graduate study and research. In just its first five years, the Drexel Philosophy BA program graduated students into careers including teaching, the law, public policy, and academic research. Co-op Experiences Philosophy students at Drexel are encouraged to seek out interesting co-op opportunities related to the skills and interests they are developing through their philosophical studies and potential career options they would like to explore. These can be as broad as the difference between an ethics-related co-op that has the student shadowing an ethicist working for a hospital’s board of institutional review, to a student who is interested in aesthetics and politics working with the Philadelphia Mural Arts Program in liaison with community groups. Students in philosophy who are pre-law frequently pursue law-related co-ops and co-ops at public and private agencies and organizations that employ lawyers and law students. Students in philosophy who are thinking about careers in academia have the full gamut of writing, editing, and publishing co-ops available to them, as well as research-related co-ops they can develop by working with professors. While academically oriented co-ops and co-ops in the humanities generally pay less than those in the sciences, business, law, and engineering—if they pay at all—they are still enormously valuable as a way for students to develop a sense of what various careers might actually be like and how they work.

It prepares students for a wide variety of excellent careers that require thoughtful analysis and engaged leadership including, but not limited to, public service, government, international and domestic business, law, community organizing, publishing, journalism, education, academic research, and more. PPE began in the early 20th century at Oxford University in the United Kingdom in an effort to ensure that scholars were ready to apply their learning in practical, governmental, and business contexts to become leaders and change agents. Historically, political science and economics descend from what had been called “political economy.” PPE acknowledges what is often lost in the separation and specialization of these fields—the political wisdom that understands economic imperatives and the economic intelligence that recognizes the limits of political initiative. The philosophical dimension of PPE represents the vital reflective and critical aspects that are essential to bringing political and economic insights into conversation for understanding and leadership. PPE is devoted to the idea that great learning should inspire and empower students to have an impact on the world. Students in the Drexel BA in PPE begin with the interdisciplinary class PPE 101 Introduction to Philosophy, Politics and Economics , which presents the field through a discussion of how the aims and methods of the three constitutive disciplines work together and discussion of the political, economic, and philosophical dimensions of specific topics and themes. The Philosophy classes in the major are mainly focused on issues in ethics, logic, philosophy of law, and social and political philosophy. The Politics classes cover a variety of subjects and constitute a solid foundation in political science covering topics that include comparative politics, history of political thought, qualitative or quantitative research methods, theories of justice, American foreign policy, social protest movements in comparative perspective, and more. The Economics classes are designed to give the student a foundation for profound analysis and insight. These include microeconomics, macroeconomics, economic ideas, public finance, and electives chosen from courses which include Game Theory and Applications, Economics of Small Business, Labor Economics, Comparative Economic Systems, Resource and Environmental Economics, and more. PPE majors are encouraged to take a minor or certificate in a field they are interested in studying. Students interested in careers in the law are encouraged to consider adding a minor in Law offered through the Kline Law School, for example. The College of Arts and Sciences offers minors in many PPE-adjacent fields including Sociology, offering courses like Race, Ethnicity and Social Inequality, Wealth and Power, Gender and Society, Development and Underdevelopment in the Global South, Environmental Justice, etc. Other popular minors and even double majors for PPE students to consider include History, Global Studies, Criminal Justice Studies, and Science, Technology, and Society. In the senior capstone course PPE 450 , students work with an instructor as they formulate, evaluate, and criticize public policy proposals, research, and/or theoretical perspectives on political and economic issues using the research tools, arguments, and methods drawn from the three fields. PPE majors at Drexel have access to the widest range of co-op positions related to public service, government, international and domestic business, law, community organizing, education, publishing, journalism, academic research, and many more areas.

Where some healthcare professionals focus on treating individuals after they become sick or injured, public health professionals are concerned with the health of entire populations, attempting to prevent problems from occurring or recurring through education, policy development, advocacy, service, and research. Reflecting the interdisciplinary approach of the Dornsife School of Public Health , students in the major will take courses originating from the various public health core disciplines which include epidemiology, community health and prevention, environmental and occupational health, and health management and policy. The diversity in course offerings provides students with the general foundation of each discipline within public health. Student learning is enhanced by faculty expertise from a wide array of backgrounds including epidemiology, community health, global health, sociology, psychology, medicine, health policy, health economics, industrial hygiene, and anthropology, in addition to many more. As students progress through the major, they will gain more breadth and depth in the specific discipline of their choosing through the co-op experience, as well as the capstone courses in their senior year. The Dornsife School of Public Health is dedicated to the integration of social justice and human rights in academic public health and being a model for interdisciplinary collaboration and civic engagement. Additionally, a commitment to global engagement is core to the School's mission. The Global Public Health Initiative was created to provide opportunities for all public health students to gain rich and meaningful experiences working on health issues that transcend national boundaries or that may be influenced by circumstances or experiences in other countries. Upon completion of the degree, students will be better equipped to complete graduate education in public health or health sciences. Students will have acquired skills that could be translated into the workplace (city, state, or local government, nonprofit, etc.) or other post-baccalaureate educational settings such as an MPH, JD, or MD.

It also features specialized coursework relating to social justice issues. Sociology is the systematic study of societies. Society is the sum total of individual and group interactions and relations from small groups and families to global networks and complex social organizations. The discipline covers a wide variety of fields of inquiry. Sociologists examine structural relations and are committed to developing a critical understanding of these relationships. Thus, the Sociology major stresses theory, research methods, and quantitative and qualitative data analysis. These are then applied to a wide variety of substantive areas including, but not limited to, social inequality, political power, gender, sexuality, class, race, ethnicity, family, health, cities and neighborhoods, technology and environmental change, as well as social and political movements connected with social change. The stress on critical understanding means that Sociology majors will strive not only to develop strong analytic abilities but an intellectual and ethical engagement reflected in sociologically informed thinking and action. The research and analytical skills developed in our program are sought after by a wide variety of professions . Specialized social justice coursework is typically carried out in connection with community groups and organizations. It is a way the Sociology Program and Drexel University as a whole seek to become practically engaged with the wider community while promoting social justice .

About the Program Technology and your future career prospects are evolving at lightning speeds. Where it was once as simple as pursuing “website design” or “programming,” today’s world offers—and demands—more. To truly succeed in tech, you need creativity, versatility, and an interdisciplinary skillset. You need to be able to see through the eyes of the user and understand projects from start to finish. You need to be a unicorn. User Experience & Interaction Design (UXID) helps you get there. By combining principles from a range of disciplines, UXID gives you the tools not only to understand technology but also the human principles underpinning it. You’ll get exposure to: User Experience Design (UX) — Researching and advocating the needs of people who will be using technologies, prototyping digital products, and working with agile methodologies User Interface Design (UI) — Using tools, like the Adobe Creative Suite, to create visual experiences for technology products Interaction Design (IxD) —The design of behaviors, animations, and sounds for digital products Development — Programming the code (HTML/CSS, JavaScript, PHP/MySQL, etc.) that makes products work in a variety of media (websites, apps, augmented and virtual reality, Internet of Things, etc.) Information Architecture (IA) — Organizing and planning information systems for digital products Content Strategy — The planning, creation, delivery, and governance of content, including text and imagery Project Management — Managing work flows to keep teams on track As a freshman, you learn the basics of user interface and interaction design. In sophomore year, you learn the coding and development skills to bring those designs to life. In the pre-junior year you will learn the fundamentals of user experience design and usability testing. Your junior and senior studies are focused on electives and interdisciplinary teamwork. In our 5-year sequence you will also have the opportunity for 3 six-month full-time work experiences within a company through Drexel’s Cooperative Education program, and your capstone project will result in a full-scale, industry-level product launch. By the end of this program, you’ll have real-world experience, an enviable portfolio, and the highly adaptable skills to find your way in the uncertain, ever-evolving world of tech.

        "About the Program": "Major: Westphal Studies Degree Awarded: Bachelor of Science (BS) Calendar Type: Quarter Minimum Required Credits: 180.0 Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) code: 50.0101 Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) code: 27-1019 About the Program The Westphal Studies program provides an individualized course of study initiated by a student. The student must have completed two terms of their junior year in an Antoinette Westphal College of Media Arts & Design major to be eligible for admission into this major. A small number of students in the Antoinette Westphal College of Media Arts & Design decide that their goals lie at the periphery of the major or the intersection between several majors, and would be served by more latitude than offered in the highly specified courses in their major. For these students, the Westphal Studies program major broadens future career goals and allows exploration combined with a focused exposure to a second field. It acknowledges the specialization that is characteristic of the majors in the college and the expectations of the professional fields for which our students are being prepared. Simultaneously, it recognizes the breadth and rapidly changing nature of many disciplines and permits a student who has acquired a basic working knowledge of a specific aspect of media, arts and design to investigate a clearly defined alternative. Admission to the program is limited to currently matriculated College of Media Arts & Design students who have completed the major-intensive sophomore year and experienced a co-op placement or completed their junior-year courses. The following items are required as part of the application: A student-generated, individualized plan of study, developed with and signed by a member of the Westphal Studies Program Advisors Committee A statement in writing of the student’s goals in applying to the major and the rationale of how the proposed plan of study addresses those goals A definition of appropriate co-operative education placement if the student has not completed a six-month employment in the field of their major A letter from the student’s current program director Approval by the Westphal Studies Program Advisors Committee is required for admission to the major; it is not automatic upon request. The committee must be convinced by the validity of the applicant’s reasons for applying, the proposed study plan and accompanying documentation. Details about the application procedure may be obtained from the director of Westphal Studies Program. Recommended Plan of Study This program requires an individualized plan of study. Students sign off on this agreed-upon plan with the director of the Westphal Studies program. A student must have completed two terms of junior year in a College of Media Arts & Design major to be eligible for admission into this major. The student, in consultation with their advisor and the director of the program, devises a personalized interdisciplinary study plan. The approved plan of study provides a rationale for the concentration and how the elective credits are to be used. This plan of study must be completed and approved before admission into the major.",

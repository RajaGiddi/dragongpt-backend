This program is designed for those residents who publish research and pursue scholarly activities in addition to their typical residency training, and who desire to pursue careers in clinical education in their field of interest.\nStudents pursuing an MS in Academic Medicine must designate a concentration. At this time the first available concentration is the field of otolaryngology.\nThe MS in Academic Medicine is designed to address topics of value to the academic physician, including training in leadership, education, ethics, professionalism, public health, health accreditation, statistics, bioepidemiology, research techniques, medical writing and editing, grant writing, research regulations, public speaking and academic health center management.\nThese are topics typically important to educators, but not commonly covered in depth during residency training.\nGoals and Objectives\nThe MS in Academic Medicine provides a structured pathway for physicians planning careers as clinical educators to acquire specialized knowledge and to demonstrate a special expertise in teaching. The objectives of the MS in Academic Medicine include:\nTraining young physicians to be skilled clinical educators\nProviding students with core knowledge about academic medicine that is not included systematically in residency training programs\nEncouraging research\nExposing students to the process of supervising and mentoring research\nEncouraging lifelong continued study of materials and methods for clinical education\nExaminations\nAll residents are required to take in-service training examinations annually. This is a national, standardized test provided for each clinical specialty. Performance at the 70th percentile or better in this examination is considered a passing grade for the MS. Alternatively, board certification would be sufficient to acknowledge that the student has mastered a body of knowledge suitable for the MS degree. Each clinical specialty has its own (very rigorous) requirements for board certification, supervised by the American Board of Medical Specialties.",

This program is designed to prepare emerging leaders with the advanced knowledge, skills, and innovative strategies to excel in their field.\nDesigned for working professionals, the EdS program can be completed in just two-years of part-time, flexible online study. Students enrolled in the EdS program will complete a series of core courses focused on key subjects including educational leadership, innovation, research, and evaluation. The program experience culminates with an applied Capstone project where students draw on the concepts and skills developed through the program.\nThe EdS program also has select graduate-level certificates embedded within the requirements. During the course of the program, students will complete either one (1) 18-credit certificate or two (2) 9-credit certificates to be selected from a pre-approved list of options. Certificates are included to allow students to delve deeper into select areas of specialization and to apply the concepts learned in the core courses of the program in different contexts.\nABD to EdS Pathway\nThis program also supports a pathway for students who have completed all coursework toward an education-focused doctoral degree program (at Drexel or another institution) but did not complete the dissertation (commonly referred to as “ABD”) who want to return and earn a valuable credential. ABD students may apply some of their previously completed coursework to the EdS ALLI program and pursue a shortened path to completion of the EdS. Potential transfer credits must be approved by the academic program and must have been completed within 5 years of applying to the EdS program at Drexel. ABD students who enroll at Drexel will complete a minimum of two (2) required core courses, one (1) 9-credit certificate selected from the available options, and the two-part Capstone project.\nAdditional Information\nFor more information about this program, please visit the\nSchool of Education website\n.",

Students interested in the management of arts and cultural organizations, including museums of all types, will find a curriculum that provides them with a broad foundation of understanding the history and current trends of the sector, as well as opportunities to explore specific areas of practice in more depth.\nStudents will choose either an Arts Administration or a Museum Leadership concentration to complete their degree. All AADM students will complete several introductory courses appropriate to their concentration, along with seven shared core AADM courses, followed by a thesis sequence for the Arts Administration concentration, and a practicum sequence for Museum Leadership.\nStudents may enroll in the program on a full- or part-time basis. The program is designed to accommodate working students, so all classes are offered in the evening or online. Students must matriculate in either the campus or online program, but students in either program may take some courses in the other program.\nStudents should plan to enter the program at the start of either the fall or spring term. Full-time students may complete the degree in five consecutive terms when beginning in the fall term, and part-time students typically take seven to eight terms to complete the degree.\nGoals and Objectives\nDrexel’s Arts Administration program will prepare the cultural workforce of the future to fulfill their missions of stewardship and education. These leaders will develop a knowledge and skill base to steer tomorrow’s museums, cultural organizations, and cultural enterprises.\nGraduates of the program will:\nDemonstrate awareness of the changing environment of the sector and use critical thinking skills to identify issues and broad-based policy solutions.\nDemonstrate knowledge of the administrative theories and practices of arts and cultural organizations, including corporate structures, business models, governance, leadership, management, planning, capitalization, evaluation, marketing, audience and community engagement, legal issues, and fund development.\nUnderstand the particular requirements of managing artistic and cultural disciplines and distinguish among the needs and requirements embedded in the management and leadership of various disciplines in the profession.\nDemonstrate capacity for leadership in the cultural community, having an awareness of their own leadership strengths, ethical standards, and ability to motivate and engage others.\nIdentify strategies to implement the mission and vision of an organization.\nWork effectively in teams, demonstrating competence in interpersonal communication and collaboration that can be applied in a leadership role or from any position within a team or an organization.\nAdditional Information\nFor more information please visit the\nWestphal College Graduate\nwebpage.",

This program is geared toward individuals interested in careers focused on technology development.\nGraduates will be prepared to progress into more advanced graduate studies in science and/or careers in scientifically oriented management jobs in the public or private sector (e.g., technology commercialization offices, patent agencies). These individuals will also be competitive law school applicants if they chose to continue their professional studies — even though credits for their legal coursework in this program will not be transferable for law school credits.\nCurriculum\nThis is an interdisciplinary online program offered by the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences and Professional Studies within the College of Medicine. The science courses, which are offered online, are taught by faculty from Drexel University College of Medicine. Faculty from Drexel University's Kline School of Law teach the law courses.\nNon-thesis program (36.0 semester credits needed to graduate)\nRequired and elective courses in each discipline\nFlexible internship elective (experiential learning)\nCustomizable plan of study\nFormat\nOnline (select courses in both disciplines are offered face to face on campus)\nNew students admitted each fall and spring semesters\nClasses taught throughout the year (fall, spring and summer)\nAccelerated: one-year MS (full-time) or 1.5 years (part-time)\nFull-Time and Part-Time Options\nStudents may meet the degree requirements on either a full-time (at least 9.0 credits per semester) or part-time basis. Full-time students generally complete the program in one year. Part-time students must complete the program within four years. Students must enroll in at least 4.5 semester credits of College of Medicine courses to qualify for financial aid.

Biostatistics is an integral and indispensable tool in improving health and reducing illness through efficient and appropriate analysis of data collected to answer health-related research questions. Biostatisticians play essential roles in designing studies and analyzing research data. MS graduates are often employed in public health research and service organizations, university research groups, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, health-related industries, contract research organizations, policy think tanks, foundations, and government. The demand for biostatisticians in the job market has been consistently strong and growing for the past decade. New technologies are generating an unprecedented amount of data which present exciting opportunities for biostatisticians with strong computational skills\n.\nThe program provides students with a thorough understanding of biostatistical methods, strong computational and communication skills, and the ability to apply this knowledge to research focusing on health-related problems. The program equips students with the relevant skills to handle the quantitative and computational aspects of a research project including study design, data collection and management, developing analysis plans, conducting analyses, and reporting findings both orally and in writing. Coursework includes statistical theory and methods, computing and data management, epidemiology, and general public health topics. A highlight of the program is the incorporation of a faculty-guided practicum experience working on a real academic, government, or industry project in a sponsoring organization setting. The practicum-based research project will involve the application of biostatistical analysis to a problem of significance to the sponsoring academic, government, or industry organization with joint oversight provided by a department faculty member and an on-site PhD-level biostatistician.\nAdditional Information\nFor more information about this program, please contact:\nDSPH Academic Advising Team\nOffice of Education\n​\ndsphadvising@drexel.edu\nAdditional information can be found on the\nDornsife School of Public Health\nwebsite, including admissions criteria and\nhow to apply.",

Students will receive a strong, quantitative foundational core in statistical theory while simultaneously having opportunities to apply these concepts to a wide range of health applications. An important feature of the program is deliberate exposure to more contemporary quantitative concepts in data science.\nThe program offers interdisciplinary instruction and research opportunities that are designed to provide a solid training in both statistical theory and in applications of biostatistical methods to a variety of relevant contexts that are central to modern interdisciplinary research, while providing practical skills to effectively contribute to the interdisciplinary research. The program will prepare students for successful careers in academia (both teaching and research), government agencies, private health-related organizations/industries, and many other data-driven industries.\nStudents will take a comprehensive exam that requires them to synthesize foundational coursework and demonstrate mastery of public health competencies. Students will then develop and defend a dissertation proposal and complete a dissertation of publishable quality and final defense.\nAdditional Information\nFor more information about this program, please contact:\nDSPH Academic Advising Team\nOffice of Education\n​\ndsphadvising@drexel.edu\nAdditional information can be found on the\nDornsife School of Public Health\nwebsite, including admissions criteria and\nhow to apply.",

The degree often acts as an advanced preparation for independent investigators and other practicing researchers familiar with clinical research while developing their clinical careers.\nThe program is also available to other clinical health professionals such as nurses (with a minimum of a bachelor’s degree required), medical technologists, etc., to help advance their professional opportunities.\nOnline coursework coupled with supervised independent research activities will allow health care professionals in any academic hospital setting throughout the U.S. to receive an MS degree from Drexel University College of Medicine.\nResearch Project\nWhile the MS in Clinical Research for Health Professionals program does not require a thesis, the program is consistent with a master’s-level education that challenges students to clearly express well-organized thoughts in written form. The collection, analysis and refinement of scientific information to produce a professional-level written document are crucial skills for those in the health professions. This requirement will expose students to the entire process of developing an independent research project and reporting on that research project up to and including experiencing a facsimile of the peer review and resubmission process. The research project will provide students with the opportunity to develop, test and report on research hypotheses.\nIt is anticipated that each student will conduct a minimum of 9 hours of research per week for 3.0 credits per semester. Research may include a broad spectrum of clinical studies such as retrospective studies, bench-top studies in conjunction or not with pharmaceutical companies, development of new clinical methodologies/techniques or development/evaluation of new medical devices. Research mentors must be established researchers with a doctoral degree. A key requirement of this mentored research is the support of a doctoral-level mentor/advisor located at the institution where the student's research will be conducted. A curriculum vitae of the proposed research mentor must be submitted with the student’s application for evaluation by the admissions committee and the program director. The appropriateness of the mentor will be evaluated by an ad hoc committee whose members come from the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences and Professional Studies faculty. The student must submit a 7- to 10-page journal-format paper at the end of each semester, documenting their research and demonstrating that each successive semester’s work builds upon their prior work.\nAdditional Information\nRobert Sterling, PhD\nDirector, Graduate Programs in Clinical Research\nrcs336@drexel.edu\n267.359.2310\nFor more information about the program and to apply, visit the\nDrexel University Online\nwebsite.",

The program also encourages interdisciplinary approaches to the study of communication and media through faculty strengths in anthropology, communication, linguistics, and sociology.\nThe MS degree requires 45.0 credits of graduate-level coursework and the review by two faculty members of a major research or critical paper that has come out of the student’s work while in the program.\nDepending on how many courses are taken each year, the program can be completed part time in two to five years. Full time completion takes five terms, or just under a year and a half.\nAdditional Information\nFor more information, please visit the\nCommunication, Culture and Media\nweb page.",

Students will be taught to assess, guide and evaluate patient use of alternative modalities and to integrate CIH into one’s own professional practice. The program provides core competencies in complementary and integrative health, offering a theoretical basis for applying complementary and integrative health practices. The curriculum emphasizes the integration of evidence-based CIH therapies such as phytomedicine, functional nutrition and mind/body modalities within the framework of conventional health care practice.\nA foundational principle of this program is interdisciplinary practice and collaboration with the goal of improving health outcomes. In addition, students will be introduced to historical, indigenous health care practices and upon graduation may seek further training to build expertise in a particular modality (e.g. yoga, nutrition, reiki, etc.) which may lead to additional credentialing or licensing.\nThe\nAmerican Holistic Nurses Credentialing Corporation, Inc.\nhas endorsed Drexel University's Complementary and Integrative Health Master's and Certificate programs, which allows graduates of these programs to sit for the nationally accredited board certification in holistic nursing.\nStudents from Drexel University’s online MS in Complementary and Integrative Health degree program are eligible to apply and concurrently enroll in the University of Arizona's Andrew Weil Center for Integrative Medicine (AWCIM) Integrative Health & Wellness Coaching (IHW) certification program. The concurrent completion of the AWCIM IHW coaching program can count toward the nine elective credits requirement for the Drexel MS in Complementary and Integrative Health program. The AWCIM IHW Coaching program is approved by the National Board of Health and Wellness Coaching. Graduates of Drexel’s MS in Complementary and Integrative Health in combination with the AWCIM IHW Coaching program would then be eligible to sit for the national exam. If you are interested in this option, you may either answer the related questions on the Drexel MS in Complementary and Integrative Health application or you can let your academic advisor know of your interest.\nLearn more about the program\n.\nProgram Mission and Values\nThe program mission is to develop leaders in complementary and integrative health care. We are committed to developing competent practitioners through exemplary and rigorous training in the clinical applications of complementary and integrative health; comprehensive curricula incorporating theoretical foundations, research and evidence-based practice; and provision of extensive support and mentorship to advance the integrative health care professional role. All efforts in the program are designed to build knowledge, enhance practice, foster professional integrity, promote innovation, engage in interdisciplinary collaboration and ultimately improve the health outcomes of patients and families from diverse communities across the continuum of care.\nIntended Audience\nThis program is applicable to a wide range of health care professionals including nurses, advanced practice nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, psychologists, women’s health practitioners, members of oncology organizations, clinical nutritionists, psych/mental health nurse practitioners and couple and family therapists.\nThis program is congruent with the educational standards set forth by the American Holistic Nurses Association (AHNA) and meets the core competencies of the Academic Consortium for Integrative Medicine & Health.\nAdditional Information\nFor more information about this program, contact:\nGraduate Nursing Division\nCNHPGraduateDivision@drexel.edu\nAdditional information is also available on Drexel's College of Nursing and Health Professions\nMS in Complementary and Integrative Health\nwebpage and on the Drexel University Online\nMS in Complementary and Integrative Health\nwebpage.",

Students next convene in New York to meet with publishers, agents, and editors. Accomplished authors give craft talks at all residencies. Students have the opportunity to attend an optional craft retreat in Collioure, France, and all students come to University City for a culminating graduation residency on campus. The MFA curriculum is enriched by a robust schedule of optional remote evening talks by publishing industry professionals and authors.\nThis degree actively provides students with tools and skills needed to forge professional ties and rewarding careers in creative writing, thus leveraging Drexel’s historical approach to education, which is experiential and career focused. To this end, the Drexel M.F.A. provides select students with opportunities to learn teaching pedagogy for composition and/or creative writing, and to take part in one-of-a-kind, community-based learning experience designed to spark creativity, make a positive impact in the world, and put tools in students’ hands for post-M.F.A. employment.\nGraduates will be equipped to create and market their own books. Graduates will also be prepared to seek work in literary magazines, literary marketplace publications and conference organizers, publishing houses, literary retreat centers, community-based writing organizations, and in literary agencies.\nDrexel's Creative Writing M.F.A. sets forth as a founding principle that art and industry are essential partners in improving the human condition and that storytellers have key roles to play in effecting positive change for individuals and society at large.\nAdditional Information\nFor more information, contact:\nNomi Eve\nDirector, Drexel MFA in Creative Writing\nDepartment of English and Philosophy\nnae28@drexel.edu",

Specialty\ncoursework also centers around dance movement as (1) a tool for communication, creativity and expression; (2) essential for growth and development; and (3) situated within cultures. In-class experientials and didactic learning inform each student's simultaneous on-site, community educational experiences with individuals and groups.\nProgram graduates are eligible for the Registered Dance/Movement Therapist (R-DMT) credential with the American Dance Therapy Association (ADTA) as well as professional counseling licensure in Pennsylvania (upon completion of post-graduation requirements).\nBecause licensure requirements vary from state to state, students interested in attaining post-graduation counseling licensure are encouraged to check the requirements for any state(s) where they plan to work and practice. In addition, the students must begin to know and understand the requirements for any future licensure they may seek.\nThe profession is positioned to meet an increasing interest in mind-body approaches to mental and physical health that have emerged in health profession circles and in the general public. Upon graduation, students utilize their skills to work in a variety of settings such as schools, early intervention programs, community mental health, inpatient psychiatry, medical, social service and wellness settings. Students also engage in innovative therapeutic applications through clinical work and research.\nAdditional Information\nFor more information about the program, visit the College of Nursing and Health Professions\nDance/Movement Therapy and Counseling\nwebsite.",

Students will build upon those skills and develop a critical understanding of how the industry evolves, so they can forecast the future and prepare employers for what’s coming.\nAre a scholar with significant knowledge in the field of digital media and want both to advance that knowledge and to apply it to research problems across disciplines. Students can expand their universe of possibilities in areas like gaming, animation, virtual and augmented reality, or immersive media in general.\nThis program is STEM designated.\nIn this interdisciplinary doctoral program, students will focus on translational research with emphasis on an iterative and design-based research philosophy. They will study the application of digital media towards solving research problems in disciplines such as engineering, education, cultural heritage, health, and business.\nAdditional Information\nFor more information, visit Drexel's\nGraduate Studies in Digital Media\nwebpage.",

                "overview": "Major: Education\nDegree Awarded:\nDoctor of Philosophy (PhD)\nCalendar Type: Quarter\nMinimum Required Credits:\n74.0\nCo-op Option\n: None\nClassification of Instructional Programs (CIP) code:\n13.0101\nStandard Occupational Classification (SOC) code:\n25-1081\nAbout the Program\nVision\nThe Ph.D. in Education is designed for those who aspire to be education researchers, university faculty, or research analysts. The program is designed so that students will have the skills, knowledge, and experience to be leaders and stewards of the field. Graduates from this program cultivate research and critical thinking abilities directed toward the creation of new knowledge, integration and original application and/or teaching of existing knowledge, and scholarly inquiry in their field of study.\nApplicants to this program are expected to have a high aptitude for research and inquiry in the field of education. They will express career interest in topics in which the faculty of the school is actively inquiring and researching. The assumption is that the most effective training for the Ph.D. stems from collaborative research and inquiry into topics of mutual interest by an able student and faculty scholars and researchers. The major emphasis of the program consists of the individual students and faculty members(s) jointly researching and inquiring into an area of study to conduct scholarly research.\nMission\nThe emphasis of the program is philosophical underpinning and theory-driven research. In addition to studying a variety of educational topics (e.g. educational leadership and policy; STEM education; teacher education and the foundation of education), the program requires extensive preparation in quantitative and qualitative research methods. Students will be immersed in scholarly opportunities, learning to teach and conducting research with faculty while completing coursework and other program requirements. These three areas will combine to:\nConvey deep scholarly knowledge of education and related areas outside of education\nPromote a broad understanding of various methods of inquiry in education and develop competency in several of those methods\nImpart broad knowledge of theory and practice\nPromote excellence as a researcher, instructor, or leader in the field of education\nCore focus courses in PK-20+ Education focus and expand the identity of the program to include social justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion in educational research across the PK-20 continuum which are all signature characteristics of both the School of Education and Drexel's strategic missions.\nCohort and Delivery Format\nThe Ph.D. in Education program offers two formats: part-time and a full-time fellowship model. Both options are delivered on-campus and situated in the framework of collaborative, transformational learning and knowledge generation. Small seminars, independent projects, and practicum opportunities are designed for an individualized program.\nPart-time Model:\nThe program also offers a part-time, self-paid model. The Ph.D. in Education part-time program is individualized, interdisciplinary, experiential, and is designed for inspiring scholar-practitioners in education, including those in public or private schools, community colleges, government agencies, professional associations, and other education-related settings. The Ph.D. is a research-based program that equips scholar-practitioners with the knowledge and skills needed to thrive in educational settings. Our mission, to prepare the educational researchers of tomorrow, is accomplished through the implementation of a rigorous doctoral program that emphasizes high quality educational research utilizing varied methodological approaches.\nFellowship Model:\nStudents enrolled in the full-time, fully funded option participate in a 20-hour per week fellowship, and receive a generous stipend and health insurance subsidy. The fellowship model is highly competitive and small by design, admitting only 8-10 students annually. The Ph.D. in Education fellowship is a rigorous program designed to prepare students for careers as educational researchers, scholars, and educational scholar leaders. The program involves intensive coursework in education and educational research. Curriculum involves both formal coursework and professional research and development activities in the education field. Students work closely with faculty members and collaboratively engage to focus on solving significant educational problems, often receiving course credit for independent studies in problem-based research activities. For the individual student, most guidance will come from their faculty advisor and his or her committee members.\nFellowship Statement\nIt is the policy of the School of Education that individuals that are appointed to the Ph.D. Fellowship within the Ph.D. program must abide by the guidelines stated below.\nScope & Focus of Fellowship Ph.D. Program\nThe School of Education Fellowship Ph.D. program works on a mentorship model where incoming doctoral students work closely with faculty and administrative leaders on collaborative projects. The School’s new fellowship model will be replacing our previous assistantship program model. The Ph.D. Fellowship will provide tuition remission, a living stipend, and health insurance subsidies through a\nrotation of administration, teaching, and research experiences within the School of Education\n. The goal of this rotation is to scaffold the student experience to afford opportunities for a holistic understanding of various faculty and administrative responsibilities. Fellowship assignments will be made on an annual basis contingent on recommendations from faculty, Dean, and Ph.D. program director, as well as availability of appointments. All fellowship assignments will undergo a review via an annual evaluation by the immediate supervisor to be shared with the Ph.D. program director. This evaluation will be included in the student annual review to serve as both accountability and reflective metrics to further the\ntransfer of learning\nfrom the fellowship experience. Multiple fellowship appointments might occur; however, fellowship assignments should not exceed a combined 20 hours per week. In addition to assigned fellowships, each Fellow will also have other responsibilities that include, but not limited to, a\nttend and present at professional conferences, collaborate with faculty on publications and research projects, attend professional development opportunities, and serve as a student ambassador to help promote and recruit for the Ph.D. program\n.\nResponsibilities & Procedures\nPh.D. Fellows are fully funded graduate students who are employed in part-time capacity with the School of Education. All duties and services of Ph.D. Fellows are to be carried out under the supervision and direction of faculty or administration. Ph.D. Fellows must be enrolled as a student as a condition of their continued employment within the School of Education. Ph.D. Fellows must remain in good academic standing. Good academic standing is defined by a GPA of at least 3.0. Failure to meet these requirements will be grounds for withdrawal of the appointment and termination of employment. In addition, Ph.D. Fellowships must be making satisfactory progress toward an advanced degree. While being funded, all Ph.D. Fellows are required to maintain an on-campus presence during the Fall, Winter, and Spring Term. (Note: Refer to the Graduate School Vacation Policy for more details about leave). Appointments for Ph.D. Fellows may not exceed 20 hours per week.\nDuties of Ph.D. Fellowships\nPh.D. Fellowship appointments are made with the understanding that the required program duties will contribute to the student’s professional and academic training. Ph.D. Fellows shall engage in research and professional development as assistants to members of the faculty or administration of the School of Education. Ph.D. Fellowships appointment will include the following assignments:\nAdministrative Service\n(AS): The student will be responsible for non-instructional duties. These positions are offered either through professional offices or programs at the School of Education, departmental, and/or program level. This position is intended to foster professional development to transfer learning via administrative responsibilities that can possibly be connected to research interests of the Fellows. The aforementioned is subject to availability of appointment.\nTeaching Assistant\n(TA): The student is responsible for assisting faculty members both inside and outside the classroom on projects related to the instruction of a particular course\nor\nteaching a course as the faculty of record. The latter is on a case-by-case basis, as well as subject to course availability. All TAs will have a faculty mentor to provide support and guidance throughout the term. One course will count as 10 hours of the students required 20 hour per week work requirement.\nResearch Assistant\n(RA): The student will work with faculty on academic and research projects. RAs assignments are often tied to grant-related funding projects and are, thus, administered independently by the funding PI. Students need to note that\nnot all\nresearch appointments will necessarily align with their particular research, though the program will attempt to make those connections when possible. As an RA, the goal is to provide students an opportunity to transfer learning from scholarly aspects of research to tangible aspects of research.\nDismissal and Termination of Appointment and Procedure for Grievances\nPh.D. Fellowship appointments are terminated after four years of enrollment in the graduate program; however, in the event that the Ph.D. Fellow becomes ineligible for continued appointment through unsatisfactory academic progress within the program and failure to success complete academic milestones (such pass comprehensive exam or proposal defense). In addition, appointments may also be terminated at any time for nonacademic reasons, such as for failure to perform the required duties of the position or other personnel reasons. Every effort should be made to resolve grievances informally between the Ph.D. Fellow and the employing faculty member. If resolution cannot be met a formal grievance process must be followed through with the Ph.D. program director.\nCompensation\nWith the assistantship, all students are expected to fulfil a 20 hours per week rotation in administration service, teaching, and research to the School of Education. The student will receive a stipend in the amount of $20,000 for nine months beginning October 1 and ending June 30. During this appointment period, the assistantship also includes tuition remission per quarter for the Fall, Winter, and Spring. In addition, all Fellows will receive health insurance subsidies. Review the\nattached link for more information about the health insurance program\n.\nPlease note that if a student graduates prior to the end date specified, their fellowship appointment will be terminated at the end of their final quarter. In the event the student does not fulfill their professional duties to the satisfaction of the department, their assistantship can be terminated at any time.\nAdditional Information\nFor additional information, please visit the School of Education's\nDoctoral Degree program website\n.",

                "overview": "Major: Education Improvement and Transformation\nDegree Awarded:\nMaster of Science (MS)\nCalendar Type: Quarter\nMinimum Required Credits:\n45.0\nCo-op Option\n: None\nClassification of Instructional Programs (CIP) code:\n13.9999\nStandard Occupational Classification (SOC) code:\n11-9032\nAbout the Program\nThis program is intended for adult learners with an interest in advancing their career in the field of education and who want to self-design a program that is tailored to their individualized needs. Appropriate for those students pursuing traditional education pathways—becoming a PK-12 teacher or moving into school administration, for example—it is an equally good choice for those wanting to make a positive impact on our education system and students, whether PK-12 or post-secondary, through different kinds of professional paths. The MS in Education Improvement and Transformation is a customizable degree. Students select from 12 areas of study to pursue some combination of three-course Professional Development Concentrations (PDCs) and Post-Baccalaureate Certificates (PBCs), then 9.0 credits of elective courses available in the School of Education and other schools and colleges in Drexel, and then complete a three-course, research-based capstone project relevant to their own career pursuits. Both the PDCs and the PBCs are comprised of focused coursework in a specific area.\nCurrently available PDCs include:\nCollaborative Special Education Law and Process:\nPrepare to meet the unique learning needs of students with disabilities through legally mandated school, home, and community collaboration.\nCreativity and Innovation:\nLearn how to think like a creative professional, apply creativity to your chosen career, tap into your innate creativity, and investigate strategies to implement your ideas in an educational setting.\nEducation Policy:\nGain insight into the policy-making aspect of education, with an emphasis on American policy and the ethics behind creating educational policies.\nEntrepreneurship:\nLearn tools used by successful entrepreneurs and apply your knowledge through social experiential learning experiences.\nEvaluation and Assessment:\nEven the most successful education institutions need to evaluate their performance. This concentration focuses on the evaluation process and how to effectively assess institutions on multiple levels.\nHigher Education Leadership:\nDevelop the skills and knowledge necessary to begin or advance your career in higher education administration and leadership. Coursework prepares students for roles in diverse institutions and organizations within the broad field of higher education.\nInstructional Design for e-Learning:\nPrepare to effectively and efficiently design learning environments and experiences in diverse organizational settings using a variety of media.\nLeadership in Educational Settings:\nGain the knowledge and skills needed to be a leader in an educational setting, and examine how educational leaders operate by exploring topics such as decision-making and policy.\nLearning Analytics:\nLearn to understand and improve instructional processes, the role of data in organizational change, and leadership in educational systems based on multiple data and information sources. Be prepared to make data-driven decisions about education improvement using a broad range of data collection, analytical, and visualization methods.\nMind, Brain & Learning:\nStudy mind, brain, and education science in real-world contexts and apply this knowledge through innovative teaching, assessment, and instructional design in alignment with the human learning process.\nOrganization and Talent Development:\nGain the strategic human resource development capabilities and competencies to lead talent development, coaching and mentoring, and organization development and change initiatives in any organizational setting.\nUrban Education:\nUrban education is one of the most prominent subjects in education today. Learn about the differences and similarities between urban and rural education settings, and how to resolve conflict in urban school settings, among other relevant topics.\nAfter students complete a minimum of 27.0 credits through some combination of PDCs and PBCs, they will finish the program by enrolling in three elective courses (9.0 additional credits) and then a 9.0 credit sequence that includes a research course and completion of a capstone project that allows them to synthesize the previous learning in their program and to produce work that that bears on their career goals and may have transformative impacts on our education system. The combination of the PDCs/PBCs, the electives, and the three capstone courses provides the student with the 45.0 credits required for the MS degree.\nPathways to Completion\nAs the graphic below indicates, students have two defined pathways to earning the MS in Education Improvement and Transformation:\nOption A:\nA student may choose to pursue as many as three of the PBCs listed below, and \"stack\" the credits earned in conjunction with these (up to 27.0) towards the degree requirements (45.0 credits). To do this, a student will need to apply to enter the MS program no later than the time of completion of their second PBC.\nOption B:\nA student may choose to enroll in the MS program from the outset and pursue the 45.0 credits needed to earn the degree. They can do this by completing up to three PDCs listed above OR by earning up to three PBCs from the list below OR completing a combination of PDCs and PBCs adding up to three.\nIn the case of either Option A or Option B, after earning 27.0 credits, the student will be required to select elective courses totaling 9.0 credits, and then complete a 9.0 credit research-based capstone project sequence.\nPost-Baccalaureate Certificates available:\nOrganizational and Talent Development\nU.S. Education Policy\nCreativity Tools and Techniques for the Classroom and Workplace\nInstructional Design for e-Learning\nLearning Analytics\nAdditional Information\nFor more information, visit the Drexel University\nMS in Education Improvement and Transformation\nwebpage.",

                "overview": "Major: Educational Leadership and Management\nDegree Awarded:\nDoctor of Education (EdD)\nCalendar Type: Quarter\nMinimum Required Credits:\n59.0\nClassification of Instructional Programs (CIP) code:\n13.0401\nStandard Occupational Classification (SOC) code:\n11-9033\nAbout the Program\nThe Doctor of Education (EdD) in Educational Leadership and Management is\na part-time doctoral program designed to be completed in three or five years. The EdD experience ensures graduates develop the advanced knowledge, skills, and dispositions to solve complex problems of practice and lead change at the individual, group, and organizational levels.\nThe curriculum focuses on sustainable leadership, systems inquiry, equity and social justice, and research in practice. The EdD program prepares graduates for leadership roles in public school districts, universities and colleges, foundations and organizations, corporations, healthcare organizations, and/or government agencies.\nDesigned for working professionals, the EdD is offered in two formats: (1) completely online with both virtual and one-on-one sessions with faculty (and no residency requirement); and (2) in a hybrid, “executive” format delivered online (60%) and on-campus (40%) in Philadelphia or Washington, D.C., on three weekends per quarter. To provide ultimate flexibility, both formats offer a three-year plan of study with students taking two courses per term, and the online format also offers a five-year plan of study with students taking one course per term. University\npolicy\nrequires that students complete the EdD program within seven years of the initial date of matriculation.\nThe Drexel EdD program has a national reputation as an innovative leader in the field. Drexel is a proud member of the\nCarnegie Project on the Education Doctorate\n(CPED)—a member organization of more than 100 institutions working together to continuously improve the EdD as preparation for scholarly practitioners. In 2019, CPED named Drexel's EdD the EdD Program of the Year.\nEdD students learn in cohorts, supporting and challenging each other as they move together through the program. The curriculum includes core leadership courses focused on sustainable leadership; research courses that provide opportunities for students to apply their learning in real-life settings and prepare for dissertation study; and a doctoral dissertation experience wherein students complete a dissertation in practice.

Close School of Entrepreneurship is founded on the principle that entrepreneurship encompasses more than starting a new venture. Entrepreneurship is a habit of mind and an attitude; a skill set applicable to pursuing innovation in both personal and career contexts; as well as an approach to life built around innovative thinking, calculated daring, and proactive behavior.\nThe MS in Entrepreneurship and Innovation is designed for recent graduates or working professionals who wish to increase their knowledge of and experiences in innovation and entrepreneurship and to gain fluency in how to communicate, finance, or market a new idea, product, or initiative. The MS focuses on developing the entrepreneurial mindset and the skills associated with new-venture creation and corporate innovation. The MS in Entrepreneurship and Innovation will teach students to understand the principles and methods of idea generation and development, such as design thinking, systems thinking, and cultivating creativity. Students will develop knowledge and skills that foster and manage a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship/intrapreneurship within their current organizations as well as developing the skills to apply business frameworks and models to organizational objectives and goals to drive innovation and entrepreneurial initiatives.\nAdditional Information\nFor more information about the MS in Entrepreneurship and Innovation, please contact Justin Fithian\njmf465@drexel.edu\n.",

Students gain experience in the design of epidemiologic studies and in the analysis of data. Epidemiology and Biostatistics faculty focus on a range of analytic approaches and their application to a spectrum of topics including social inequalities in health, neighborhood differences in health, chronic and infectious disease epidemiology, the epidemiology of health across life stages, nutrition, physical activity and obesity, and clinical research. Career paths in epidemiology often involve data collection, analyses, and interpretation to inform policy and practice in governmental, private, nonprofit, academic, and healthcare settings. Epidemiology graduates may also manage research studies that lead to changes in decision making in public health.\nAdditional Information\nFor more information about this program, please contact:\nDSPH Academic Advising Team\nOffice of Education\n​\ndsphadvising@drexel.edu\nAdditional information for the face-to-face program can be found on the\nDornsife School of Public Health\nwebsite, including\nadmissions criteria and\nhow to apply\n.\nAdditional information for the online program can be found on the\nDrexel University Online\nwebsite, including\nadmissions criteria and\nhow to apply\n.",

It emphasizes health promotion and disease prevention. Family nurse practitioners primarily practice in ambulatory care settings, such as primary care clinics, physician offices, HMOs, outpatient clinics, schools, nursing centers, emergency departments, long-term care facilities, industry, the armed services, public health departments, correctional institutions and home health agencies. Graduates of the program are eligible to sit for the ANCC’s Family Nurse Practitioner Examination and/or the AANP’s Family Nurse Practitioner Examination.\nThe nurse practitioner faculty is committed to quality and excellence in the nurse practitioner (NP) programs. Students meet on campus for mandatory On-Campus Intensive (OCI) learning experiences, simulation and evaluation. Students will attend an in-person on-campus intensive in\nNURS 534\nfor four days during week one of the summer quarter. Dates are subject to change. During the OCIs, students engage in simulated clinical learning experiences conducted in the College of Nursing and Health Professions' state-of-the-art, multidisciplinary patient simulation lab. These visits provide direct guidance and mentoring from faculty and the opportunity to collaborate with peers.\nMandatory, on-campus visits are essential to students transitioning into the NP role.\nThe program is accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education.\nAdditional Information\nFor more information about this program, contact:\nGraduate Nursing Division\nCNHPGraduateDivision@drexel.edu\nAdditional information is available on Drexel's College of Nursing and Health Professions\nMSN in Family/Individual Across the Lifespan Nurse Practitioner\nwebpage and on the Drexel University Online\nMSN in Family/Individual Across the Lifespan Nurse Practitioner\nwebpage.",

It emphasizes health promotion and disease prevention.\nFamily nurse practitioners primarily practice in ambulatory care settings, such as primary care clinics, physician offices, HMOs, outpatient clinics, schools, nursing centers, emergency departments, long-term care facilities, industry, the armed services, public health departments, correctional institutions and home health agencies. Emergency nurse practitioners primarily practice across the emergency care continuum. This rigorous program provides the education and skills necessary to function as a competent nurse practitioner and leader in primary care and emergency care populations. In addition to preparing students for the primary care role across the lifespan, this program prepares students with the diagnostic and therapeutic procedures skills specific to the emergency care setting.\nGraduates of the program are eligible to sit for the ANCC’s Family Nurse Practitioner Examination and/or the AANP’s Family Nurse Practitioner Examination. In addition, graduates are eligible to sit for the AANP’s Emergency Nurse Practitioner Examination.\nThe nurse practitioner faculty is committed to quality and excellence in the nurse practitioner (NP) programs. Students meet on campus for mandatory On Campus Intensive (OCI) learning experiences, simulation and evaluation. Students will attend an in-person, on-campus intensive in\nNURS 536\nfor one day during week one of the winter quarter. Students will attend an in-person, on-campus intensive in\nNURS 673\nfor two days during week one of the winter quarter. Dates are subject to change.\nMandatory on-campus visits each quarter are essential to students transitioning into the NP role.\nDuring the OCIs, students engage in simulated clinical learning experiences conducted in the College of Nursing and Health Professions' state-of-the-art, multidisciplinary patient simulation lab. These visits provide direct guidance and mentoring from faculty as well as the opportunity to collaborate with peers.\nThe program is accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education.\nAdditional Information\nFor more information about this program, contact:\nGraduate Nursing Division\nCNHPGraduateDivision@drexel.edu\nAdditional information is available on Drexel's\nCollege of Nursing and Health Professions\nwebpage and the\nDrexel University Online\nwebpage.",

It stresses the development of the aesthetic and philosophical concepts of fashion design and the technical skills to support research and experimentation in these concepts. A typical graduate sequence is comprised of eleven terms of graduate courses and may include one term of prerequisite coursework, beginning with the summer term accelerated design and drawing courses.\nThe curriculum integrates 2D and 3D design to address the physical, aesthetic, psychological, and social requirements of fashion. It is structured so that studio, laboratory, and classroom work give the graduate student a directed experience in the study of aesthetics, criticism, and contemporary art concepts; contemporary and historic art and design; traditional and current fashion technology; the discipline of drawing; and the making of art. A required industry internship affords the graduate student direct experience in a workplace of their choice.This comprehensive approach provides the basis for a broad range of employment in the fashion and design industries and in education. Other professional opportunities lie in merchandising, costume design, curatorial work, and computer-aided design.\nThe faculty of the Department of Design includes art historians, CAD and 3D design specialists, apparel designers, knit designers and programmers, fiber artists, merchandising specialists, new materials and processes researchers, painters, and sculptors. The department also draws on practicing professionals as adjunct professors for specialized coursework and for critique of student work.\nA limited number of graduate assistantships are available to students after completing the\nfirst year.\nA thesis and/or capstone collection is required. A professionally juried annual fashion show provides competitive fashion industry and department awards and excellent exposure for the graduate students' design thesis. Drexel students can participate in the activities of the Fashion Group of Philadelphia, the local chapter of an international fashion industry organization. The Fox Historic Costume Collection, a rich resource of inspiration, is located in the URBN Center. Philadelphia has many fine museums and galleries and is an affordable bus ride to New York City. Students are encouraged to attend local and regional fashion events.\nThe 79.0 graduate quarter credits do not include any of the required prerequisite coursework not waived by program review. See the Admission Requirements for a list of courses students are expected to have completed prior to beginning their graduate study.\nAdditional Information\nFor more information about this program, please contact the program director:\nJackie Kilmartin\njk942@drexel.edu",

All courses, except for the residency, will be conducted online through\nDrexel University Online\n. The residency, based at Drexel University's University City campus, is designed to provide students with a full master's level collaborative experience with on-campus and/or community activities and the experience of working directly with health care or public health service organizations to improve the planning, delivery and evaluation of these services. Students will be prepared for leadership roles in health-related businesses or organizations.\nThe program is designed for experienced health care professionals seeking to explore the three areas of health leadership - transformation, execution and people. The program's curriculum is grounded in the business of health care with every class focusing on real-life application to some aspect of the health care industry. The curriculum is led by experienced on-campus faculty and addresses three core areas:\nBusiness of Health Management\nHealth Methodologies\nHealthcare Policy and Health System\nStudents collaborate to produce an Applied Management Project which will be assigned in groups as a culminating project for the program. In this project, students will apply management tools and/or research tools to address particular administrative challenges, assuring that students think at an organizational level and use particular strategies to respond to change.\nIn addition to the content of the Applied Management Project, self-confidence and self-development are integrated in the management courses and the on-campus portion of the program, which encourages self-reflection, application of theoretical perspectives and synthesis of data and management tools. In the online portion of the course, students engage in threaded discussions with classmates about their completed projects.\nThis curriculum is designed to help students achieve their goals on a timeline that fits their lifestyle and allows a student to graduate in 18 months up to three years. Students also have the option to enter during the fall or spring term.\nAdditional Information\nFor more information about this program, please contact\nCNHPAdvising@drexel.edu\n.",

Students will benefit from engagement with the Department of Health Management and Policy’s interdisciplinary faculty, the Dornsife School of Public Health’s emphasis on urban health and social justice, and the School’s location in Philadelphia—the 6th largest city in the United States where dynamic networks of academic, government, non-profit, and community-based organizations share a commitment to addressing health problems.\nThe program prepares researchers and scholars for careers in universities and other organizations, such as governmental agencies and private health-related industries (insurers, pharmaceuticals, philanthropic foundations, etc.), where health services research is conducted. Graduates will serve to improve the US health care system and individual and population health outcomes through research and advocacy.\nThe program’s four core areas of study are based on principles articulated in the Institute of Medicine report on\nHealth Services Research: Training and Workforce Issues\n:\nSocial and Political Determinants of Health and Health Systems: The multi-level factors that affect the health of individuals and populations and that undergird US health systems.\nResearch Methods: The methods for investigating health services research and policy questions that involve collecting, analyzing, and interpreting health and health services data.\nHealth Economics: The supply and demand of health care resources and the impact of allocation and scarcity of these resources on populations.\nImplementation Science: Approaches to designing and implementing health services interventions at multiple levels using community engagement strategies.\nResearch Specialization: Elective courses outside of program requirements selected at the student’s discretion, with faculty mentor approval, that focus on topics applicable to the student’s research interests.\nStudents will take a comprehensive exam that requires them to synthesize coursework and demonstrate mastery of public health competencies. Students will then develop and defend a dissertation proposal and complete a dissertation of publishable quality and final defense.\nAdditional Information\nFor more information about this program, please contact:\nDSPH Academic Advising Team\nOffice of Education\n​\ndsphadvising@drexel.edu\nAdditional information can be found on the\nDornsife School of Public Health\nwebsite, including admissions criteria and\nhow to apply.",

Students who enter the MS in Human Nutrition planning to become an RDN are automatically admitted to one of our ACEND-accredited partner dietetic internships.\nStudents complete the didactic (classroom) portion of their training at Drexel, followed by their supervised practice (internship) with one of our partners.\nPartners include Yale New Haven Hospital Dietetic Internship, University of Maryland Medical Center Dietetic Internship, Virginia Commonwealth University Dietetic Internship and Tulane University Dietetic Internship. The degree is completed full-time in one academic year (12 months; 9.0-12.0 credits per term). S\ntudents are admitted only in the fall term. All students complete a capstone project in their final term.\nNutrition Sciences Track\nThe Nutrition Sciences track prepares students for entry into doctoral-level study in nutrition or other health care disciplines (eg. medicine) or employment in industry. The degree focuses on nutrition research and requires completion of a thesis.\nIn addition to the core curriculum, students select specialty courses relating to their major as well as electives. Completion of the track requires two academic years.\nCurrent research in human nutrition includes\nthe prevention of obesity and diabetes across the lifespan; community engagement to improve healthful food access, availability and exposure in school and clinic-based settings\n; diet and cancer survivorship; and dietary intake of participants of home-delivered therapeutic meals\n.\nCurrent research in nutrition science includes\ndopamine-mediated mechanisms of food intake regulation in humans and its impact on metabolic homeostasis, especially as it applies to obesity, eating disorders and aging; identifying potential unique food safety risks for minoritized, racial/ethnic and low-income populations; and understanding whether novel dietary interventions can influence bone-regulating hormones, bone mineral density, pro-inflammatory cytokines and energy metabolism.\nAdditional Information\nVisit the College's\nMS in Human Nutrition webpage\nfor more information.",

Students in this program acquire theoretical and practical knowledge about the normal functions of the immune system and disease pathogenesis associated with immunological dysfunction. Students also learn how this knowledge is applied to develop tools for diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of immunologically-based diseases. Graduates from this program will be ready to enter the biotechnology workforce and are attractive candidates for doctoral programs in science and medicine, as well as higher professional degree programs, such as medical, veterinary and physicians’ assistant schools.\nThe Master of Science in Immunology program is designed to provide academic and practical biotechnical knowledge in translational research, particularly in the areas of immunotherapeutics and vaccine development.  It is available in both traditional on-campus and online formats.\nCurriculum\nThe two-year non-thesis program encompasses fundamental requirements to establish a sound grounding in immunology, biochemistry, genetics, and cellular and molecular biology. The program is typically completed in two full-time years (four semesters of at least 9 credits) of required and elective graduate courses, and one or more experiential research components in the first or second year. The flexibility of the curriculum enables students to complete the degree requirement within 18 months on an accelerated basis and up to four years on a part-time basis. The successful completion of the degree will be determined by grades obtained in the graduate courses, participation in seminars and journal clubs, and performance in the research component. A minimum of 36.0 credits is required to graduate. Although the research component is an elective, students may choose to undertake 6.0 research credits toward completion of the degree program.\nThe experiential research component of the curriculum, if chosen, can be fulfilled by two alternative approaches. Most students choose to engage in an intensive 6.0 credit hands-on research internship in which a 12-16 week research program will be undertaken in a laboratory at Drexel University, another academic institution, or at a biotechnology or biopharmaceutical company. Alternatively, students may choose to engage in a less intensive experience spanning two semesters, or conduct an independent research project with the approval and supervision of the program directors. If a research project is not available, students may choose to prepare a detailed review of the literature in their chosen field of interest.\nTraditional (Face-to-Face), Hybrid or Online Learning Options\nFor the traditional on-campus format, classes can be attended at either of Drexel University College of Medicine's locations: the Center City and Queen Lane Campuses in Philadelphia. State-of-the-art video conferencing provides real-time interactive learning at these locations. Most classes are held in the late afternoon/early evening to facilitate participation of working professionals. Classes may be designed as hybrid courses, using a combination of online and traditional in-class learning materials. The program may also be completed in a fully online format. All required courses and most electives have online sections and online students experience the same curriculum as face-to-face or hybrid students. Online sections are designed to maximize interactions among students and faculty and may include live web sessions. Individual students also may choose a mix of traditional and online (hybrid) courses. The goal is to provide maximum scheduling flexibility.\nAdditional Information\nFor more detailed information about the curriculum and program goals, please contact either:\nStephen Jennings, PhD\nEmail:\nsrj32@drexel.edu\nPooja Jain, PhD\nEmail:\npj27@drexel.edu",

Online learning, synchronous activities, and research experiences cover fundamentals of molecular biology, cell biology and immunology, as well as the basic science, translational and clinical aspects of diseases caused by important infectious pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, HIV, methicillin-resistant\nStaphylococcus aureus\n(MRSA), malarial parasites and influenza virus. Elective courses offer highly focused studies of topics relevant to infectious disease, including: vaccines and vaccine development; viral, bacterial, parasitic and fungal pathogens; emerging pathogens; principles of biocontainment; and emerging biomedical interventions for human diseases.\nThe program is designed to prepare students for careers in infectious disease in government, industry and academic settings. The program is ideally suited for enhancing the scientific credentials of recent college graduates, early-career scientists, premedical students, employees in industry and clinical laboratory technicians.\nCurriculum\nThis non-thesis degree program comprises numerous required and elective graduate courses, as well as an elective research internship that can be completed during the training program.\nAlthough learners can complete the program in two years (four semesters) as full-time students, many opt to enroll on a part-time basis, taking three or more years to complete the degree program. Elective courses available to students in the program provide additional knowledge and expertise in areas relevant to infectious disease research, such as emerging infectious diseases, vaccines effective against infectious pathogens, biotechniques and laboratory research, and laboratory biosafety. Graduate courses in the curriculum involve completion of examinations and other assessments, participation in seminars and journal clubs, and (if applicable) performance of research in the field of infectious disease. The degree is conferred upon successful completion of a minimum of 36.0 credits of course work.\nLearning Format\nThe Master of Science in Infectious Disease program features a completely online curriculum.\nStudents accepted into the program will take courses designed with activities that maximize interactions among students and faculty, including live (synchronous) sessions with instructors and guest speakers. Most synchronous activities are scheduled in the late afternoon/early evening to facilitate the participation of working professionals.\nExperiential Learning\nA signature element of the program is the research internship in infectious disease. The internship encompasses one of three specific areas of research in the field of infectious disease:\nBasic science discovery involving infectious bacterial, viral, fungal or parasitic pathogens that cause human disease\nTranslational research focused on the development of new approaches to diagnose, prevent or treat infectious diseases\nClinical infectious disease research focused on infectious diseases in humans\nMany students choose to engage in a hands-on research internship consisting of a 16-week research project in a laboratory at an academic institution or a company that specializes in biotechnologies or pharmaceuticals. Students in the online program can make arrangements with academic institutions or biotechnology companies near where they live or work. Alternatively, online students may choose to engage in independent research projects with the approval and supervision of the program director.\nBecause the research internship in infectious disease is an elective course, students can instead choose to earn all 14 elective credits by completing lecture-based elective courses offered as part of the curriculum.\nAdditional Information\nFor more detailed information about the curriculum and program goals, please contact:\nFred Krebs, PhD (Director)\nEmail:\nfck23@drexel.edu\nVisit the website for more information about the online\nMaster of Science in Infectious Disease\nprogram.",

This program allows students to become stronger applicants to medical or other health professional schools by enhancing their academic credentials through a customizable biomedical curriculum. The IHS program also helps students to find and engage in meaningful community service experiences and provides an opportunity to supplement biomedical coursework with laboratory or clinical research.\nIHS students complete multiple required courses throughout their first and second years. These courses provide general knowledge and training essential for a career in health care. The IHS program offers students a broad range of elective courses from which to choose, and students receive personalized guidance from a program advisor as they select those electives that best meet their needs and interests.\nDuring the second year of IHS, students select a concentration track and complete a specified number of courses within that concentration prior to graduation. In this way, the IHS curriculum is both flexible and structured in its goal of reinforcing the health care career interests of each student. Also during their second year, students select one of three Capstone Project Tracks: (1) Independent Research Track, (2) Laboratory/Clinical Research Track, or (3) Community Service Research Track. All tracks teach students to communicate complex scientific information in written and oral formats, and to hone their critical thinking and analysis skills.\nUpon completion of IHS, students will have a strong, integrated view of the biomedical sciences, which provides numerous advantages to graduates, whether using their degree as a springboard for further professional education or for direct entry into the health care workforce.\nStudents must complete a minimum of 48.0 credits to graduate and must complete all required courses. The awarding of the Master of Science degree will be contingent upon satisfactory completion of all program requirements, including an earned GPA of no less than 3.0.\nAdditional Information\nFor more information about the program, visit the College of Medicine's\nMS in Interdisciplinary Health Sciences\nweb page.",

Students have the option of completing the JD in the traditional three years, or through an accelerated two-year program designed to get students into the legal workforce faster with the same essential skills and knowledge.\nStudents spend their first year on campus being introduced to the foundations of legal analysis, skills, and professionalism in a diverse learning community. The program includes traditional first-year courses such as contracts, property, and criminal law, as well as a critical introduction to lawmaking and statutory interpretation through a Legislation & Regulation course. The first year also includes a comprehensive legal methods course taught by full-time faculty which instructs students on the fundamentals of legal writing and analysis.\nThe remaining curriculum exposes students to a broad array of topics relevant to the study of law. Students are required to complete courses in professional responsibility, legal writing and other practice skills, and statutory law. Students must also complete at least 50 hours of pro bono work,\ndocumented with the Law School's Experiential Learning Office\n.\nThe Experiential Education Program\nStudents are required to complete either a co-op placement or a clinical experience in order to graduate. This requirement provides students with an integrated learning experience that prepares them for the complexities of modern-day practice.\nThe cooperative education program (co-op) allows upper-level students to spend a semester at a single legal placement. The Kline School of Law has relationships with a wide-ranging selection of co-op partners including judicial chambers, private law firms, in-house counsel offices, and non-profit organizations, but has also assisted many students in creating opportunities in other practice jurisdictions. Students are not paid for their work but will instead receive academic credits for their co-op experiences and for a lawyering practice seminar that must be taken in conjunction with the co-op.\nClinical experiences offer students the chance to represent real clients in a clinical setting. Clinical offerings include a Civil Litigation Field Clinic, Criminal Litigation Field Clinic, Federal Litigation and Appeals Clinic, Community Lawyering Clinic, and an Entrepreneurial Law Clinic. These experiences are paired with seminar time that guides students through reflection on their work and its impact on the community.\nIn addition to the co-op and clinical requirement, students may also take advantage of a broad selection of simulation courses that involve in-depth trial practice, advocacy, litigation, transactional practice, and alternative dispute resolution.\nAbout the Concentrations\nThe Thomas R. Kline School of Law builds on some of the strengths for which Drexel University is nationally known by offering five optional concentrations. These are areas in which there are expanding employment opportunities and a need for specialized knowledge and skills: intellectual property, health, business and entrepreneurship, criminal law, and civil litigation and dispute resolution. These concentrations consist not only of specialized courses taught in the classroom, but also experiential learning opportunities such as co-ops and simulations.\nDual Degrees\nFor those law students interested in pursuing expertise in another area of study, the School also offers several dual degrees combining ﻿law with other subjects, including Law and Business Administration (JD/MBA), ﻿Law and Clinical Psychology (JD /PhD), Law and Public Health (JD/MPH), and Law and Public Policy (JD/MPP). For more details about dual degree opportunities, visit the Thomas R. Kline School of Law\nDual Degree website\n.\nAdditional Information\nFor more information about the JD program, visit the the\nThomas R. Kline School of Law\nwebsite.",

Students have the option of completing the JD in the traditional three years, or through an accelerated two-year program designed to get students into the legal workforce faster with the same essential skills and knowledge.\nStudents spend their first year on campus being introduced to the foundations of legal analysis, skills, and professionalism in a diverse learning community. The program includes traditional first-year courses such as contracts, property, and criminal law, as well as a critical introduction to lawmaking and statutory interpretation through a Legislation & Regulation course. The first year also includes a comprehensive legal methods course taught by full-time faculty which instructs students on the fundamentals of legal writing and analysis.\nThe remaining curriculum exposes students to a broad array of topics relevant to the study of law. Students are required to complete courses in professional responsibility, legal writing and other practice skills, and statutory law. Students must also complete at least 50 hours of pro bono work,\ndocumented with the Law School's Experiential Learning Office\n.\nThe Experiential Education Program\nStudents are required to complete either a co-op placement or a clinical experience in order to graduate. This requirement provides students with an integrated learning experience that prepares them for the complexities of modern-day practice.\nThe cooperative education program (co-op) allows upper-level students to spend a semester at a single legal placement. The Kline School of Law has relationships with a wide-ranging selection of co-op partners including judicial chambers, private law firms, in-house counsel offices, and non-profit organizations, but has also assisted many students in creating opportunities in other practice jurisdictions. Students are not paid for their work but will instead receive academic credits for their co-op experiences and for a lawyering practice seminar that must be taken in conjunction with the co-op.\nClinical experiences offer students the chance to represent real clients in a clinical setting. Clinical offerings include a Civil Litigation Field Clinic, Criminal Litigation Field Clinic, Federal Litigation and Appeals Clinic, Community Lawyering Clinic, and an Entrepreneurial Law Clinic. These experiences are paired with seminar time that guides students through reflection on their work and its impact on the community.\nIn addition to the co-op and clinical requirement, students may also take advantage of a broad selection of simulation courses that involve in-depth trial practice, advocacy, litigation, transactional practice, and alternative dispute resolution.\nAbout the Concentrations\nThe Thomas R. Kline School of Law builds on some of the strengths for which Drexel University is nationally known by offering five optional concentrations. These are areas in which there are expanding employment opportunities and a need for specialized knowledge and skills: intellectual property, health, business and entrepreneurship, criminal law, and civil litigation and dispute resolution. These concentrations consist not only of specialized courses taught in the classroom, but also experiential learning opportunities such as co-ops and simulations.\nDual Degrees\nFor those law students interested in pursuing expertise in another area of study, the School also offers several dual degrees combining ﻿law with other subjects, including Law and Business Administration (JD/MBA), ﻿Law and Clinical Psychology (JD /PhD), Law and Public Health (JD/MPH), and Law and Public Policy (JD/MPP). For more details about dual degree opportunities, visit the Thomas R. Kline School of Law\nDual Degree website\n.\nAdditional Information\nFor more information about the JD program, visit the the\nThomas R. Kline School of Law\nwebsite.",

Kline School of Law and Dornsife School of Public Health and earn degrees from both. They acquire basic skills in both disciplines and gain a unique perspective on their intersection. The first year of study is at the Law School, where students complete the standard first-year curriculum. They take full-time public health courses during either their second or third year at their option. At the Dornsife School of Public Health, they major in Health Management and Policy for the MPH, learning skills necessary for policy-making, management, and legal roles in health care and population health. After completing the MPH curriculum, students return to the Law School to complete the law curriculum. As part of their studies, they take a co-op in a public health law setting and complete a related written public health project. Students typically finish both programs in three-and-a-half years.\nStudents are awarded the JD and MPH degrees at the end of the dual degree program once all degree requirements for the JD and MPH are completed.\nAdditional Information\nFor more information about this program, please contact:\nDSPH Academic Advising Team\nOffice of Education\nDornsife School of Public Health\n​\ndsphadvising@drexel.edu\nTheresa Gallo\nAssistant Dean of Academic & Student Services\nThomas R.

Although many employers do not want to hire additional attorneys, they require employees with sophisticated and narrowly focused exposure to law and legal regulation.\nThe Master of Legal Studies (MLS) program is a post-baccalaureate degree designed for individuals to develop and improve career-related skills through the study of the legal system, legal writing, law, regulation, and policy. Ideal candidates include individuals in other disciplines, professionals who would benefit from focused legal knowledge (such as those in the fields of health, college sports, education, human resources, finance, etc.), individuals seeking career changes, and those generally interested in the field of law. Upon completion of each degree program, graduates will understand how the law relates to and impacts their particular areas of interest although they will not be attorneys.\nCurrently, the following concentrations are offered (optional):\nCriminal Law\nCybersecurity and Information Privacy Compliance\nEntrepreneurship and Law\nFinancial Regulatory Compliance\nHealth Care Compliance\nHigher Education Compliance\nHuman Resources Compliance\nNCAA Compliance\nPharmaceutical and Medical Device Regulatory Compliance\nAdditional Information\nFor more information, visit the\nOnline Master of Legal Studies\nwebsite.",

                "overview": "Major: Molecular Medicine\nDegree Awarded: Master of Science (MS)\nCalendar Type: Semester\nMinimum Required Credits: 36.0\nClassification of Instructional Programs (CIP) code: 26.0204\nStandard Occupational Classification (SOC) code: 19-1029\nAbout the Program\nMission Statement\nThe Master of Science in Molecular Medicine program, offered by the Department of Microbiology & Immunology and by the Institute for Molecular Medicine & Infectious Disease (IMMID), provides education and training in areas of research in human health at the molecular level. Students in this program acquire theoretical and practical knowledge about normal body functions and disease pathogenesis at the molecular level. Students also learn how this knowledge is applied to develop novel tools for diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of disease. Graduates from this program will be ready to enter the biotechnology workforce and are attractive candidates for doctoral programs in science and medicine, and for higher professional degree programs, such as medical, veterinary and physicians’ assistant schools.\nThe Master of Science in Molecular Medicine program is designed to provide academic and practical biotechnological knowledge in translational research, particularly in the areas of molecular therapeutics and vaccine development. It is available in both traditional on-campus and online formats.\nCurriculum\nThe non-thesis program encompasses fundamental requirements to establish a sound grounding in microbiology, biochemistry, genetics and molecular biology. The program is typically completed in two full-time years (four semesters of at least 9.0 credits) of required and elective graduate courses and one or more experiential research components in the first or second year. The flexibility of the curriculum enables students to complete the degree requirement within 18 months on an accelerated basis and up to four years on a part-time basis. The successful completion of the degree will be determined by grades obtained in the graduate courses, participation in seminars and journal clubs, and performance in the research component. A minimum of 36.0 credits is required to graduate. Although the research component is an elective, students may choose to undertake 6.0 research credits toward completion of the degree program.\nThe experiential research component of the curriculum, if chosen, can be fulfilled by two alternative approaches. Most students choose to engage in an intensive 6.0-credit, hands-on research internship in which a 12- to 16-week research program will be undertaken in a laboratory at Drexel, another academic institution, or at a biotechnology or biopharmaceutical company. Alternatively, students may choose to engage in a less intensive experience spanning two semesters, or conduct an independent research project, with the approval and supervision of program directors. If a research project is not available, students may choose to prepare a detailed review of the literature in their chosen field of interest.\nTraditional (Face-to-Face), Hybrid or Online Learning Options\nFor the traditional on-campus format, classes can be attended at Drexel University College of Medicine's locations in Center City or Queen Lane in Philadelphia. State-of-the-art video conferencing provides real-time interactive learning at these locations. Most classes are held in the late afternoon/early evening to facilitate participation of working professionals. Classes may be designed as hybrid courses, using a combination of online and traditional in-class learning materials. The program may also be completed in a fully online format. All required courses and most electives have online sections and online students experience the same curriculum as face-to-face or hybrid students. Online sections are designed to maximize interactions among students and faculty, and may include live web sessions. Individual students also may choose a mix of traditional and online courses (hybrid). The goal is to provide maximum scheduling flexibility.\nAdditional Information\nFor more detailed information about the curriculum and program goals, please contact either:\nPamela Norton, PhD\nEmail:\npan29@drexel.edu\nStephen Jennings, PhD\nEmail:\nsrj32@drexel.edu",

Through a balance of classroom education and clinically supervised practicum and internship experiences, students develop a strong foundation for skilled clinical practice. The 90 quarter-credit curriculum includes specific music therapy coursework in areas such as clinical musicianship, clinical improvisation, music therapy across the lifespan and technological applications as well as general mental health counseling coursework in human development, social and cultural foundations, clinical appraisal and assessment and group dynamics. All courses are taught at the graduate level. Graduates are eligible for board certification through the Certification Board for Music Therapists as well as professional counseling licensure in Pennsylvania (upon completion of post-graduation requirements).\nMusic therapists use music within a therapeutic relationship to address physical, emotional, cognitive and social needs of individuals. Research shows that music therapy is an effective treatment for children, adolescents, adults and older adults with mental health needs, developmental and learning disabilities, Alzheimer’s disease and other aging-related conditions, substance use disorders, acute and chronic pain and brain injuries. Graduates of the MA in Music Therapy & Counseling program go on to work in a variety of clinical environments, including but not limited to medical and behavioral health in-patient and out-patient settings, community health and wellness centers, schools and after-school programs, trauma-informed settings, correctional facilities, elder care facilities and private practices.\nAdditional Information\nFor more information about the program, visit the\nCollege of Nursing and Health Professions' Music Therapy\nwebsite.",

The program provides a vibrant research component leading to published scientific work in reputable journals, as well as training in the panoply of research and presentation skills required to conduct and disseminate the research. Students are provided with a curriculum of integrated courses that include the essentials for biomedical research and courses that span cellular, developmental, systems and behavioral neurosciences, as well as neuroanatomy, injury and disease of the nervous system. Upon completing these programs, students pursue careers in academic research, teaching, pharmaceutical research, industry, government, academic administration, public policy and beyond.\nThe MS program provides students a broad background in neuroscience and the techniques used in neuroscience research. In addition to the thesis-based MS program, Drexel offers a non-thesis degree program in which students can earn the degree without a research project by taking additional classes and writing a literature review paper. Students who wish to continue their graduate training after the MS degree may apply to the PhD program and their credits may be applied to the doctoral program.\nAdditional Information\nFor more information, visit the College of Medicine's\nNeuroscience program\nwebsite.",

Skills in strategic planning, governance, communication, fund development and stewardship, marketing, and innovation learned in the classroom and put into practice with partnering nonprofit entities will provide students with the essential tools to effectively carry out and lead the nonprofits’ mission.\nDrexel is steeped in the tradition of experiential learning and as a result, even though this is a full online program, there are three required experiential learning opportunities in which students work with nonprofits: Nonprofit Workshop I and II, as well as the Regional Volunteer Experience. Students have the option to work with a nonprofit for their two-course capstone sequence as well.\nThis degree equips you with the following demonstrable skills:\nCommunication:\nEnhance oral, written, and presentation skills to easily and effectively collaborate with and lead others in the workplace. Students will also learn how to communicate with outside constituents, board members, and community leaders while honoring the organization’s mission.\nCampaign Management:\nBuild the strategic planning, management, communication, and financial skills needed to effectively run annual funds and capital campaigns\nDonor Cultivation:\nUsing communication, leadership, and nonprofit sector trends, as well as specific mission information, students will learn how to cultivate interested individuals into donors, elevate small donors into capital-level donors, and maintain those relationships over time.\nEthics:\nDevelop a strong moral and ethical framework to manage mission-driven, largely volunteer-based institutions\nSelf-Assessment:\nGain the ability to examine one’s role, responsibility, and effectiveness within an organization. By acknowledging strengths and weaknesses, students can capitalize on strengths while also targeting specific areas for growth.\nProgram Delivery\nThe MS in Nonprofit Management: Public, Professional & Social Sectors is a part-time graduate degree program that is offered entirely online. Drexel University operates on a quarter schedule (four 10-week terms per academic year). Students will take two courses per quarter.\nAdditional Information\nPlease visit our\nwebpage\nfor more information about the program, admissions requirements, and application details.",

A critical care area is defined as one where, on a routine basis, the registered professional nurse manages one or more of the following: invasive hemodynamic monitors (e.g., pulmonary artery, central venous pressure and arterial catheters), cardiac assist devices, mechanical ventilation and vasoactive infusions. Examples of critical care units may include but are not limited to surgical intensive care, cardiothoracic intensive care, coronary intensive care, medical intensive care, pediatric intensive care and neonatal intensive care. Those who have experiences in other areas may be considered provided they can demonstrate competence with managing unstable patients, invasive monitoring, ventilators and critical care pharmacology.\nTechnical Standards:\nThe Nurse Anesthesia Program requires that all applicants must be able to meet the technical standards for admission, progression and graduation.

The mission of the DNP program is to prepare advanced nursing practice leaders for the application of evidence-based knowledge in practice, quality improvement and systems leadership to improve health outcomes. DNP-prepared nurses are well-equipped to fully implement the science developed by nurse researchers prepared in PhD, DNS and other research-focused nursing doctorates. DNP-prepared nurses also are able partners on research initiatives that require the input and guidance of practice experts with advanced skills as advanced practice registered nurses, nurse administrators and nursing leaders.\nUpon graduation, students will be able to:\nDesign evidence-driven health care delivery approaches using fiscally responsible and environmentally sustainable strategies to meet current and anticipated individual and population health needs across the illness-wellness continuum.\nExecute established steps of evidence-based practice when leading efforts to improve health care quality based on measurable and manageable outcomes.\nModel communication skills necessary to lead and contribute to effective interprofessional collaborations and patient care encounters to accomplish high-quality and mission-driven outcomes.\nAppraise health care systems’ delivery processes to improve quality, accessibility and/or the sustainability of health care enterprises.\nPropose policy initiatives that promote social justice and the health and wellness of all people, including those who are disparaged, oppressed or vulnerable.\nAppraise practice dilemmas using moral reasoning and legal/ethical analyses to make decisions in practice settings and to create policies that are consistent with professional codes, practice standards and laws.\nUtilize information systems/technologies to analyze health outcomes for individuals, aggregates and populations and to evaluate healthcare delivery systems.\nDemonstrate advanced specialty and role competence as an advanced practice registered nurse or as an advanced nurse in a role focused on advanced aggregate/systems/organizational expertise.\nClinical Requirements\nA minimum of 1000\npost-baccalaureate\nprecepted clinical hours are required for the DNP degree. Prescribed procedures and credentialing processes must be followed prior to starting practicum experiences. Required competencies are periodically assessed throughout the program. Practicum experiences vary in length and purpose.

Please check back in summer 2025 for an update.\nAbout the Program\nThe MSN Clinical Nurse Leader (CNL) track is designed to prepare nurses for an evolving advanced generalist role that incorporates advanced knowledge, skill and clinical expertise in an evidence- and quality-driven context. The CNL oversees care coordination of a distinct group of patients, is a resource for clinical decision-making and serves as lateral integrator of care. This clinical leader puts evidence-based practice into action to ensure that patients benefit from the latest innovations in care delivery. The CNL collects and evaluates patient outcomes, assesses cohort risk and has the decision-making authority to change care plans when necessary. This clinician functions as part of an interdisciplinary team by communicating, planning and implementing care directly with other health care professionals, including physicians, pharmacists, social workers, therapists, clinical nurse specialists and nurse practitioners. The CNL is a leader in the health care delivery system across all settings in which health care is delivered. The program emphasizes the development of competencies related to the use of technology, evidence-based practice, customization of care, health team and interdisciplinary leadership and outcome and risk assessment.\nThis online master's program prepares nurses to function effectively in a quickly changing, increasingly complex clinical care environment. Students have the opportunity to develop advanced competencies and depth of knowledge as clinical nurse leaders. The program emphasizes evidence-based approaches to solve clinical problems, assessment and evaluation of nursing and healthcare outcomes, clinical decision-making, lateral care integration, clinically based leadership and the design of nursing care for clinical populations at the clinical unit or similar small system level.\nClinical practicum experiences include the development and management of a data-driven project that provides opportunities for students to deepen evidence-based practice competencies in the management of clients’ health care needs at the point of care. Precepted clinical experiences will include activities such as modeling of care, assessment and evaluation of aggregate patient outcomes, case management and service integration, and unit and interdisciplinary team leadership, as well as teaching and mentoring of staff.\nThe program is accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education.\nAdditional Information\nFor more information about this program, contact:\nGraduate Nursing Division\nCNHPGraduateDivision@drexel.edu\nAdditional information is available on Drexel's College of Nursing and Health Professions\nMSN in Clinical Nurse Leader\nwebpage and on the Drexel University Online\nMSN Clinical Nurse Leader\nwebpage.",

Concurrent theory and clinical courses provide a knowledge base for the management of adults and older adult acute, critical and complex chronic health care conditions. Clinical practicum rotations allow students to put the principles they have learned into practice in medical, surgical and critical care settings. Upon completing the program, graduates pursue practice roles across the continuum of acute care services ranging from high-acuity, hospital-based specialty services and intensive care settings. Graduates are eligible to sit for the AACN and/or ANCC’s Adult-Gerontology Acute Care Nurse Practitioner Certification Examination.\nThe nurse practitioner faculty is committed to quality and excellence in the nurse practitioner (NP) programs. Students meet on campus for mandatory On-Campus Intensive (OCI) learning experiences, simulation and evaluation. Students will attend an in-person on-campus intensive in\nNURS 570\nfor 4 days during week one of the summer quarter. Students will attend a second in-person on-campus intensive in\nNURS 571\nfor 2 days during week seven of the fall quarter. Dates are subject to change.\nDuring the OCIs, students engage in simulated clinical learning experiences conducted in the College of Nursing and Health Professions' state-of-the-art, multidisciplinary patient simulation lab. These visits provide direct guidance and mentoring from faculty as well as the opportunity to collaborate with peers.\nMandatory, on-campus visits are essential to students transitioning into the NP role.\nThe program is accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education.\nAdditional Information\nFor more information about this program, contact:\nGraduate Nursing Division\nCNHPGraduateDivision@drexel.edu\nAdditional information is available on Drexel's College of Nursing and Health Professions\nAdult-Gerontology Acute Care Nurse Practitioner (AGACNP) program\nwebpage and on the Drexel University Online\nMSN Adult-Gerontology Acute Care Nurse Practitioner (AGACNP) program\nwebpage.",

With the elderly population in the U.S. expected to double—if not triple—by 2030, it is imperative that there is an educated workforce of health professionals able to deliver high-quality and appropriate care to the adult and older-adult population. In response to this need, Drexel University has developed an Adult-Gerontology Primary Care Nurse Practitioner (AGPC) program. The AGPC cares for individuals (aged 13 years and above) across the lifespan to promote maximal health, reduce risks and manage acute, chronic and complex health conditions. The AGPC is specifically trained to focus on health and wellness, disease prevention and quality of life in the aging population. The purpose of our AGPC program is to educate and prepare competent and compassionate AGPC graduates to provide comprehensive, quality and cost-effective care founded in evidence-based practice to adults across the lifespan on the continuum of health and illnesses.\nAll graduates will be eligible to sit for the certification exam as an adult-gerontology primary care nurse practitioner through the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners (AANP) and/or American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC).\nThe nurse practitioner faculty is committed to quality and excellence in the nurse practitioner (NP) programs.

It emphasizes health promotion and disease prevention. Family nurse practitioners primarily practice in ambulatory care settings, such as primary care clinics, physician offices, HMOs, outpatient clinics, schools, nursing centers, emergency departments, long-term care facilities, industry, the armed services, public health departments, correctional institutions and home health agencies. Graduates of the program are eligible to sit for the ANCC’s Family Nurse Practitioner Examination and/or the AANP’s Family Nurse Practitioner Examination.\nThe nurse practitioner faculty is committed to quality and excellence in the nurse practitioner (NP) programs. Students meet on campus for mandatory On-Campus Intensive (OCI) learning experiences, simulation and evaluation. Students will attend an in-person on-campus intensive in\nNURS 534\nfor four days during week one of the summer quarter. Dates are subject to change. During the OCIs, students engage in simulated clinical learning experiences conducted in the College of Nursing and Health Professions' state-of-the-art, multidisciplinary patient simulation lab. These visits provide direct guidance and mentoring from faculty and the opportunity to collaborate with peers.\nMandatory, on-campus visits are essential to students transitioning into the NP role.\nThe program is accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education.\nAdditional Information\nFor more information about this program, contact:\nGraduate Nursing Division\nCNHPGraduateDivision@drexel.edu\nAdditional information is available on Drexel's College of Nursing and Health Professions\nMSN in Family/Individual Across the Lifespan Nurse Practitioner\nwebpage and on the Drexel University Online\nMSN in Family/Individual Across the Lifespan Nurse Practitioner\nwebpage.",

Concurrent theory and clinical courses provide a knowledge base for the management of pediatric complex acute, critical and chronic healthcare conditions. Clinical practicum rotations allow students to put the principles they have learned into practice in medical, surgical and critical care settings. Upon completing the program, graduates pursue practice roles across the continuum of acute care services ranging from high-acuity, hospital-based emergency or intensive care settings to specialty-based practices. Graduates are eligible to sit for the PNCB's Pediatric Acute Care Nurse Practitioner Certification Examination.\nThe nurse practitioner faculty is committed to quality and excellence in the nurse practitioner (NP) programs. Students meet on campus for mandatory On-Campus Intensive (OCI) learning experiences, simulation and evaluation. Students will attend an in-person on-campus intensive in\nNURS 642\nfor five days during week one of the summer quarter. Dates are subject to change. During the OCIs, students engage in simulated clinical learning experiences conducted in the College of Nursing and Health Professions' state-of-the-art, multidisciplinary patient simulation lab. These visits provide direct guidance and mentoring from faculty and the opportunity to collaborate with peers.\nMandatory, on-campus visits are essential to students transitioning into the NP role.\nThe program is accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education.\nAdditional Information\nFor more information about this program, contact:\nGraduate Nursing Division\nCNHPGraduateDivision@drexel.edu\nAdditional information is available on Drexel's College of Nursing and Health Professions\nMSN Pediatric Acute Care Nurse Practitioner\nwebpage and on the Drexel University Online\nMSN Pediatric Acute Care Nurse Practitioner\nwebpage.",

The clinical practice settings for the dual certification track option provide students with a mixed inpatient/outpatient experience ranging from specialty clinics to primary care settings. Diverse clinical settings provide supervised clinical hours to allow the student advanced practitioner to perform advanced physical assessment, critical thinking, diagnostic reasoning and management of care in collaboration with licensed physicians and APNs in accredited institutions. Students graduating from this track will be eligible to sit for both the Pediatric Primary Care and the Pediatric Acute Care Board Certifications through the PNCB.\nThe nurse practitioner faculty is committed to quality and excellence in the nurse practitioner (NP) programs. Students meet on campus for mandatory On-Campus Intensive (OCI) learning experiences, simulation and evaluation. Students will attend an in-person on-campus intensive in\nNURS 642\nfor five days during week one of the summer quarter. Dates are subject to change. During the OCIs, students engage in simulated clinical learning experiences conducted in the College of Nursing and Health Professions' state-of-the-art, multidisciplinary patient simulation lab. These visits provide direct guidance and mentoring from faculty and the opportunity to collaborate with peers.\nMandatory, on-campus visits are essential to students transitioning into the NP role.\nThe program is accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education.\nAdditional Information\nFor more information about this program, contact:\nGraduate Nursing Division\nCNHPGraduateDivision@drexel.edu\nAdditional information is available on Drexel's College of Nursing and Health Professions\nMSN Pediatric Primary Care and Pediatric Acute Care Nurse Practitioner program\nwebpage and on the Drexel University Online\nMSN Pediatric Primary Care and Pediatric Acute Care Nurse Practitioner program\nwebpage.",

Graduates will be prepared to work effectively in interprofessional teams to develop, implement, manage and evaluate programs that address priority health needs.\nAs health care continues to evolve, there is an increased need for nurses trained in public health. Drexel University’s online MSN in Public Health Nursing aims to meet that need, training you to use a systems-thinking, clinical approach to advocate for resources and policies to improve the health of all populations, locally and globally. This is an interdisciplinary degree that provides the opportunity to take online courses through Drexel’s College of Nursing and Health Professions as well as Drexel's Dornsife School of Public Health. This blend of nursing education and public health foundational knowledge culminates in a capstone project where you’ll take what you’ve learned throughout the MSN Public Health Nursing program and apply it to a real-world public health issue.\nThe program is accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE).\nAdditional Information\nFor more information about this program, contact:\nGraduate Nursing Division\nCNHPGraduateDivision@drexel.edu\nAdditional information is available on the Drexel's College of Nursing and Health Professions\nPublic Health Nursing\nwebpage and the Drexel University Online\nP\nublic Health Nursing\nwebpage.",

The program of study is based on a biopsychosocial model of care and includes the study and application of diagnostic and treatment modalities and theories and approaches to practice. Graduates of this program practice in a wide variety of settings as this program enables them to provide direct (assessment and intervention) and indirect (consultation, case management and supervision) advanced practice services to individuals who are at risk and those who need mental health services. Graduates are eligible to sit for the ANCC’s Psychiatric Mental Health Certification Examination.\nThe nurse practitioner faculty is committed to quality and excellence in the nurse practitioner (NP) programs. Students meet on campus for mandatory On-Campus Intensive (OCI) learning experiences, simulation and evaluation. Students will attend an in-person on-campus intensive in\nNURS 592\nfor four days during week one of the summer quarter. Dates are subject to change. During the OCIs, students engage in simulated clinical learning experiences conducted in the College of Nursing and Health Professions' state-of-the-art, multidisciplinary patient simulation lab. These visits provide direct guidance and mentoring from faculty and the opportunity to collaborate with peers.\nMandatory, on-campus visits are essential to students transitioning into the NP role.\nThe program is accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education.\nAdditional Information\nFor more information about this program, contact:\nGraduate Nursing Division\nCNHPGraduateDivision@drexel.edu\nAdditional information is available on Drexel's College of Nursing and Health Professions\nMSN Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner\nwebpage and on Drexel University Online's\nMSN Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner\nwebpage.",

The objective of the joint MSN/PhD in Nursing is to prepare nurse scientists early in their professional career to ensure they have a longer trajectory upon which to make substantive and sustained contributions to the body of knowledge for the discipline of nursing and thereby improve health services for those who receive nursing care. Doctoral students are expected to plan and launch an independent program of research, seek needed support for initial phases of the research program and begin to involve others (i.e., students, clinicians and other researchers) in their activities.\nThis innovative program of study prepares the nurse generalist for a dual degree: the MSN in Public Health Nursing and the PhD. The program of study builds upon a research mentorship model, which recognizes that research skills are learned most effectively by working with a faculty advisor who provides opportunities to use the tools to conduct research, design and execute original research within a focused program of study.\nInnovation, leadership and interdisciplinary collaboration are strong educational values that are reflected in the Drexel University strategic plan. The PhD in Nursing program represents leadership in the field, with interdisciplinary collaboration as core administrative and curricular values basic to its philosophy and epistemology. Innovation is also central to this doctoral program as evidenced in its curriculum and research philosophy.\nAdditional Information\nFor more information, contact:\nAnna Pohuly, Executive Assistant; Nursing and Student Affairs\nCollege of Nursing and Health Professions\n60 N. 36th Street\nHealth Sciences Building, Room 11E49\nPhiladelphia, PA 19104\nPhone: 267-359-5872\nap469@drexel.edu",

Doctoral students are expected to plan and launch an independent program of research and seek needed support for the initial phases of the research program.\nThe PhD in Nursing program represents leadership in the field with interdisciplinary/interprofessional and community collaboration as core values. Innovation is also central to this doctoral program as evidenced in its curriculum plan and research philosophy.\nThis innovative program offers mentored experience with faculty, in interprofessional classrooms, with options for full-time, part-time, in-person and hybrid study.\nWhat Students Will Learn\nThe PhD in Nursing faculty are committed to teaching traditional research methods as well as innovative and emergent research approaches and paradigms. In addition to structured coursework, the program builds upon a research mentorship model, which recognizes that research skills are learned most effectively by working with a faculty mentor who provides opportunities to use appropriate tools to design and execute an original research project within a focused program of study.\nGraduates of the PhD in Nursing program possess knowledge and skills in theoretical, methodological, analytical, interprofessional and social justice-oriented approaches to conducting research designed to discover and apply knowledge in nursing science to promote health equity among individuals, families and communities.\nDoctoral faculty research interests and expertise reflect a diversity of educational backgrounds and research experiences. Early in the program, the student selects a research emphasis that needs to complement or match that of a faculty member's research work. The focal areas of faculty research currently include the following:\nAging (e.g. nutrition in aging; health of persons with dementia and neurodegenerative conditions; health of older adults with intellectual disability)\nDementia and caregiver health\nDeterminates of health and health equity for vulnerable populations\nCommunity-engaged and population health\nHealth innovation and technology\nBehavioral interventions and implementation science\nCommunity and population health\nSexual health (e.g. HIV; STI; teen-pregnancy prevention)\nBioethics\nWhat Makes this PhD in Nursing Program Unique\nThe faculty, program, college and University are strongly committed to research that promotes health and health equity and are dedicated to engaging with communities to promote optimum health outcomes. Interprofessional and interdisciplinary curricula are valued, and a robust, active and engaging learning environment is promoted and nurtured. Faculty mentors are dedicated to the learning experiences of students. Students are important participants in the opportunities of Drexel University's College of Nursing and Health Professions, a forward-thinking, progressive, effective and collaborative health care educational enterprise.\nAdditional Information\nFor more information, contact:\nAnna Pohuly, Executive Assistant, Nursing & Student Affairs\nCollege of Nursing and Health Professions\n60 N. 36th Street\nPhiladelphia, PA 19104\nap469@drexel.edu",

Using knowledge of nutrition science, biology, chemistry, physiology, biochemistry, psychology and statistics, RDNs address the nutrition needs of individuals or groups through the prevention or management of illness or chronic disease. Upon successful completion of the program, students are eligible to sit for the entry-level exam to become an RDN. This program fulfills the requirements of the Graduate Program (GP) in Nutrition and Dietetics Accreditation Council on Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND) Future Education Model Accreditation standards.\nStudents spend the first two quarters in the program in the classroom taking foundation courses. Beginning in the third quarter, in addition to taking six credits of didactic coursework, students enroll in three credits of supervised practice (24 hours per week) to develop and demonstrate competency in dietetics practice. Experiential learning is completed at locations in and around the Delaware Valley or in locations outside of the area with approval from the program director.\nDuring the last four months of the program, students complete a capstone project in a chosen concentration area. Concentrations are available with Drexel Athletics, Eat Right Philly and at a wide variety of other facilities and programs with whom the department has relationships.\nStudents have the option to complete a research thesis instead of a capstone project. Applicants are encouraged to visit the\nprogram website\nto review the research programs of the department's faculty.\nThe program is offered on a full-time basis. Students are admitted in the fall term.\nProgram Mission:\nDrexel University’s Nutrition Sciences graduate program in dietetics integrates didactic coursework with experiential learning to provide the knowledge, competencies and professional values needed to prepare students to become entry-level registered dietitian nutritionists.\nProgram Goals and Objectives\nProgram Goal #1:\nTo provide quality classroom and experiential learning to prepare graduates to become registered dietitian nutritionists and be employed in the field of dietetics.\nObjective #1:\nAt least 80 percent of students complete the program within 32 months (150 percent of the planned program length).\nObjective #2:\nOf graduates who seek employment, at least 80 percent are employed in nutrition and dietetics or related fields within 12 months of graduation.\nObjective #3:\nGraduates of the GP will rate aspects of their concentration supervised experiential learning experiences an average of \"4\" or better, on a scale of 1=poor to 5 =excellent.\nObjective #4:\nEmployers of graduates of the GP will rate ten aspects of the students' preparation for employment an average of \"4\" or better, on a scale of 1=poor to 5 =excellent within 12 months of graduation.\nProgram Goal #2:\nTo prepare graduates to take and pass the Commission on Dietetic Registration (CDR) credentialing exam.\nObjective #1:\nAt least 80 percent of program graduates take the CDR credentialing exam for dietitian nutritionists within 12 months of program completion.\nObjective #2:\nThe program's one-year pass rate on the CDR credentialing exam for registered dietitian nutritionists is at least 80 percent.\nProgram Goal #3:\nTo increase diversity in the profession by facilitating the success of students from underrepresented groups.\nObjective #1:\nAt least 25 percent of students will be from underrepresented groups.\nAdditional Information\nFor more information, visit the College's\nMS in Nutrition and Dietetics webpage\n.",

The program is the result of a partnership between the U.S. Institute of Peace’s PeaceTech Lab and Drexel’s College of Engineering and serves the dual purpose of integrating engineering and technology into peacebuilding practice and infusing conflict-sensitivity into engineering design.\nPeace Engineering will cultivate a new skillset in students by combining disciplines of study from engineering, the social dimensions of conflict, and the applied sciences. Students will learn to conduct conflict analyses and to develop ethically and technically just solutions. These solutions will be based in the understanding that conflict, and the ability to address its root causes, emerges from the dynamics and interactions of social, technical, and environmental systems. The program offers a combination of online and classroom courses, group seminars and experiential learning with partners such as the PeaceTech Lab, the U.S. Institute of Peace, community-based organizations, and government agencies.\nPeace Engineering is for students interested in work with NGOs and non-profits, and in fields that are growing rapidly due to the increased awareness of conflict and its causes (e.g., climate change). Students interested in engineering change will be empowered by widespread availability of technology that connects communities and economies, and the tools that engineers have to make positive impact on humanity. Extraordinary opportunities exist for graduates to work in the multinational, government, and non-governmental organizations that have historically led peacebuilding, stabilization, relief, and development efforts. These include the UN, WHO, World Bank, the World Food Programme, FEMA, DOS, DOD, NGOs and a host of public services within any community. Perhaps more impressive are the opportunities that are being created by the birth of the Peace Tech Industry. Engineers with a deep understanding of conflict are well suited to organizations that range from contractors involved in stabilization and development efforts, to extraction and consumer product companies working in conflict prone communities, to social entrepreneurs and their venture philanthropists developing technologies that do good.\nAdditional Information\nFor more information, please visit the\nPeace Engineering website\n.",

The program strives to foster both intellectual and professional growth in students and is reflective of contemporary practice to prepare graduates for the ongoing changes in health care delivery.\nThe Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) program prepares students for autonomous practice in physical therapy. As a science, physical therapy examines human motion at the tissue, organ and systems levels. In the clinical environment, physical therapists (PTs) examine and evaluate patients/clients and implement procedural interventions that restore physical function for all people across the lifespan. As essential practitioners in the health care delivery system, PTs assume roles in rehabilitation services, prevention and health maintenance programs and professional and community programs. As professional members of the health care team, PTs supervise support personnel, serve as consultants to other health care personnel, serve as consultants to families and caregivers, participate in administrative services and conduct clinical research. PTs also serve as advocates for health policy and standards of care that help ensure optimum care for their patients/clients.\nGraduates of the Doctor of Physical Therapy program are prepared to fulfill their professional obligations, provide leadership to the profession and use their knowledge and skills to contribute to the health care of society.\nThe regular program is 2.5 years in length and spans ten academic quarters. There is a 3.5 year program for individuals who want to progress at a slower pace and a combined\nDPT/Masters in Business Administration (MBA)\nthat can also be completed in 3.5 years. All versions of the curricula consist of integrated didactic and clinical study with an emphasis on adult learning methodology. Foundational courses are emphasized during the first year, with subsequent quarters sequenced to progress through the hierarchy of educational objectives from simple to complex. All didactic material is organized for synthesis and application to professional practice.\nAdditional Information\nFor more information, visit the\nPhysical Therapy and Rehabilitation Science\npage on the College of Nursing and Health Professions website.\nFor application instructions, visit Drexel's Graduate Admission page for the\nDoctor of Physical Therapy\n.",

Admitted students who hold a bachelor’s degree are expected to complete both the master’s degree and post-master’s portions of the Drexel curriculum. Applicants who already hold a master’s from another university may be admitted with post-master’s status if their graduate-level preparation is deemed equivalent to the master’s portion of the Drexel curriculum.\nRequirements for Students Enrolling with a Bachelor’s Degree\nFor those entering with a bachelor’s degree, the PhD program requires approximately five years to complete. The first two years of training correspond to the master’s-level studies: focusing on clinical areas such as entry-level assessment and intervention skills, psychopathology, and specialized study in clinical neuropsychology, clinical health psychology, cognitive and behavioral psychology, clinical child psychology, and/or forensic psychology. These two years also include a major focus on research skills involving statistics, research design, and supervised research experience with the mentor. Entry-level assessment, intervention, and teaching skills are also developed.\nBy the end of the first two years of study, students should have completed 45.0 credits of coursework, maintained a GPA of at least 3.5, developed and defended a thesis, passed comprehensive examinations, and completed practicum experience, both internally (Psychological Service Center) and external clinical practicum experiences. Students demonstrating satisfactory performance in these areas will be admitted to post-master’s status.\nRequirements for Students Who Already Hold a Master’s Degree\nStudents entering with a master’s degree from another university complete the PhD requirements in four to five years. The master’s degree should have included an experimental thesis. Students lacking this prerequisite will still be considered for admission, but such students will be required to complete a research project equivalent to the Drexel master’s thesis. In addition, students must demonstrate a GPA of at least 3.5 in master’s-level courses in order to be accepted for post-master’s status.\nAdditional Information\nFor more information on how to apply, visit Drexel's\nAdmissions Requirements for Psychology\npage."

The program is fast-paced, intensive, and demanding, but builds on each individual's former education, work experience, and skills.\nThe EMPH covers the major disciplines of public health, including community health and prevention, environmental and occupational health, epidemiology and biostatistics, and health management and policy, with a focus on public health practice. In addition to required public health core courses, EMPH students take additional required courses in policy, community assessment, urban health, and cohort-specific seminars. Students also choose from a range of electives based on their academic and professional interests. Students work together in the second year in their capstone course and complete an Applied Practice Experience which enables them to integrate real-world experience with classroom learning.\nEMPH students are provided with mentoring and advising opportunities both by full-time School of Public Health faculty and public health practitioners.\nAdditional Information\nFor more information about this program, please contact:\nDSPH Academic Advising Team\nOffice of Education\n​\ndsphadvising@drexel.edu\nAdditional information can be found on the\nDrexel University Online\nwebsite, including admissions criteria and\nhow to apply\n.",

Students are required to choose a specific case study topic that they will work on typically for three terms during the program. By the end of the program, students will have produced a polished, in-depth analysis of a specific case that they can use to demonstrate expertise in a given policy area.\nSpecialization Tracks: With the approval and support of the program director, students can craft a specialized course of study with their three electives or they can take courses in the following:\nEconomic Policy\nEducation Policy\nEnvironmental Policy\nHealth Policy\nInformation Policy\nNonprofit Management\nAdditional Information\nFor more information, view the\nCenter for Public Policy\npage on the College of Arts and Sciences website.

This MS degree is built upon four foundational concepts in robotics: perception, cognition, control and action. Roughly, these four capabilities comprise: 1) obtaining data from the robot’s surroundings (perception); 2) reasoning about how that data yields information about the robot’s environment (cognition); 3) mapping environmental information to a decision about how to react to the environment (control); and 4) translating that reaction decision into movement and an interaction with the physical environment (action).\nThe program is an interdepartmental program in Drexel’s College of Engineering that educates and trains students in the theory, integration and practical application of the core engineering and computer science disciplines that comprise robotics and autonomy. To be admitted, students must have a bachelor’s degree in a STEM field or demonstrate that they have acquired sufficient experience in a technical field to be able to satisfactorily complete engineering studies at the graduate level.\nStudents are also encouraged to engage in thesis research. The combined thesis and research cannot exceed 9.0 credits. The MS program is organized so that a student may complete the degree requirements in less than 2 years of full-time study or 2-3 years of part-time study.\nStudents within the Master of Science in Robotics and Autonomy are eligible to take part in the Graduate Co-op Program, which combines classroom coursework with a 6-month, full-time work experience.

The program will develop school psychologists to use scientific inquiry, problem-solving, and a parsimonious approach to data analysis and outcome interpretation in their research and practice. This is a full-time, hybrid cohort model - therefore all students are expected to be in the Philadelphia area. With the cohort model, all students begin practicum in the first year, through our partnerships with the local schools. This full-time hybrid format means all school psychology (EDSP) courses are in-person, and the remaining coursework is online, utilizing both synchronous and asynchronous learning activities. In the third year of the program, students apply skills learned through coursework by completing a 1200-hour internship under the supervision of a certified school psychologist.\nThe program adopts and supports the ecological/behavioral orientation in psychology, focusing heavily on behavioral and ecological variables that facilitate and impede individual academic success and behavioral health functioning. The program also has a strong emphasis on behavioral health across pediatric, community, and school settings with a focus on children as they function within family, school, and community systems. The program strongly emphasizes the training of school psychologists who are agents of change in children’s lives. The development of evidenced-based assessment practices, consultation knowledge and skills, behavior analytic technology, and intervention/treatment skills are central to the program's mission and are informed from a behavioral and developmental framework. There is a strong focus on \"hands on\" work in schools, clinics, hospitals, and institutions.\nThe training program has been approved by the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) for School Psychology certification in Pennsylvania. It also includes a course sequence that has been approved by the Behavior Analyst Certification Board to fulfill one of the requirements for sitting for the national board certification examination in behavior analysis.\nAdditional Information\nFor more information about this program, visit the\nSchool of Education's\nwebsite.",

Faculty from a range of disciplines contribute to a curriculum that features a broad set of perspectives, all grounded in a foundation of social theory, research methods, and writing and presentation skills. The STS program emphasizes three interrelated areas: environment and sustainability; health and medicine; and information, identities and networks. The STS Lab course is a unique feature of the curriculum—it prepares students to work as a team to address meaningful science- and technology-related topics. Working with a faculty advisor, graduate students develop an individualized plan of study that allows them to pursue their interests in depth.\nSTS students are independent thinkers who are dedicated to understanding the intersections of society, science, medicine, and technology. While STS students vary widely in their professional and educational backgrounds and career ambitions, they share a common commitment to a critical approach to our world’s most pressing technoscientific challenges.\nProspective students for the MS in STS see this educational opportunity as a crucial factor in their skill development and career advancement. They are college graduates in engineering, the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences; professionals in businesses, city, and state government offices and area hospitals; and middle and high school teachers.\nThis is a full-time, low-residency program which means students must attend an in person residency during the first week of Fall quarter in Year 1 and Year 2. The remaining courses will be offered in an online format.\nAdditional Information\nFor more information, please contact:\nKristene Unsworth, PhD\nDirector, Center for Science, Technology and Society\nku26@drexel.edu\n215.895.0277",

This theoretical basis is designed to ensure that, as the field changes, students will continue to have an intellectual framework for evaluating and implementing new technology and changing media environments. Furthermore, the program trains students in leadership skills that will help them to lead teams to be innovative communication professionals in digitized media environments and different organizational communication contexts.\nThe program emphasizes flexibility, encouraging each student, in consultation with a faculty advisor, to craft an individual course of study tailored to the student’s individual interests and career goals. Throughout the curriculum students use four Communication electives (12.0 credits) to increase communication skills or to further develop areas of specialization. An additional four free elective courses (12.0 credits) can be taken in Communication or in other departments across the university. This allows students to continue to tailor their plan of study, to add on a graduate minor, or to complete a certificate program.\nIn order to gain valuable practical experience outside the classroom, students are expected to complete the equivalent of a six-month non-credit bearing internship. To complete the internship component, students can either enroll in Drexel’s graduate coop option (for full-time on-campus students only, more details available from the\nSteinbright Career Development Center\n), or they can work in one or several full-time or part-time communication positions of their choosing. Students entering the program already possessing significant communication-related experience and thereby meeting the internship requirement can apply for an internship waiver. The program director works with each student on an individual basis to see what option best meets their needs.\nThe program specializes in two areas:\nStrategic Communication (public relations)\nDigital and Social Media Communication\nStrategic Communication\nStrategic Communication has much to offer for those looking to work in public relations as well as for-profit and nonprofit organizations. Students typically choose from courses such as PR Writing and Planning courses, Crisis Communication, Media Relations, Nonprofit Communication, and others.\nDigital Communication\nWith Communication being an area characterized by ongoing digitization, the program offers courses such as Strategic Social Media Communication, Digital Publishing, Digital Media Environments, Social Media Concepts That Matter, and others.\nStudents can attend classes on campus, full-time or part-time, or fully online on a part-time basis. They can begin the program in any academic quarter, and they can complete all required coursework in the evening. The degree requires 45.0 credits of graduate coursework and can be completed part-time in as little as two years or full-time in five quarters (just over a year).\nAdditional Information\nFor more information, visit the\nMS in Strategic and Digital Communication webpage\n.\nContact Julia May, Director of the MS in Strategic and Digital Communication program, at\njulia.may@drexel.edu\nfor more information.",

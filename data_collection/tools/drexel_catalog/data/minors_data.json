While these models are used to make decisions in domains as varied as telecommunications, energy, and environmental quality, a common set of tools for the use of such models in decision making has been developed and forms the basis of an emerging discipline in engineering policy analysis. The practitioners of this discipline need training in mathematical and social science analytic approaches, as well as an understanding of the human factors that inevitably influence real-world policy choices. The minor in Engineering Policy Analysis is designed to introduce students to these topics.",

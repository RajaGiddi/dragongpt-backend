Our constantly evolving and fast-paced culture requires a new approach to a liberal arts education that embraces both the breadth of knowledge acquired through the liberal arts and the depth of knowledge made possible through experiential learning. Innovation requires versatility \u2014 we must not only be experts in our fields, but also agile enough to engage in the cross-disciplinary work needed to address modern problems resourcefully. That\u2019s why our co-op program inserts students within a professional culture, introducing them to the expectations of the job while offering hands-on, practical application of coursework. It\u2019s why students in Drexel\u2019s community-based learning courses don\u2019t just read about complex, global issues; they study alongside the people affected by them \u2014 in prisons, hospitals, hospice centers and more. And it\u2019s why, starting as early as freshmen year, students team with faculty members as peers, conducting research that affects the worldnow. Here in Drexel's CoAS, we are committed to implementing sustainable change because it\u2019s what the world needs. Our vision is to be locally, regionally, nationally and globally recognized for impactful research, scholarship, creative inquiry and civic engagement. We are a leader in experiential learning through our Co-op program, community-based learning courses, and undergraduate and graduate research opportunities. By pursuing excellence in research and scholarship, we educate our students to become ethical professionals and citizens with knowledge of and appreciation for the fundamental interactions among the humanities, social sciences, and the sciences in a fast-changing, challenging, and diverse world. CoAS aims to identify and address the grand challenges of our world through our research, teaching and community outreach. The College\u2019s dedicated, engaged faculty and staff train and educate new leaders to provide vision and direction in an ever-changing world. Through our emphasis on experiential learning, community engagement and hands-on research experiences, students learn to identify and solve societal challenges. Educated in modes of inquiry ranging from historical to scientific, from theoretical to data-driven, students are prepared to participate in local, regional and global communities in thoughtful, meaningful ways.",

We define health broadly to encompass physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely as the absence of disease or infirmity. We view the focus on the health of populations as a distinguishing feature of the field of public health. Our focus on population health requires us to consider not only the characteristics of individuals but also the broader social, economic, and policy contexts of health. It also implies that a broad range of actions and policies beyond those of the health care system can substantially impact health. Improving population health requires a fundamental commitment to social justice and the elimination of inequities in health. The goal of improving population health also cannot be achieved without meaningful and sustained partnerships. DSPH is committed to providing rigorous evidence and training, to building equitable partnerships, and to translating knowledge into actions that improve population health and reduce health inequities. Special distinguishing features of DSPH include a commitment to social justice and health equity, and engaging with local and global partners to create meaningful change via policy and public health practice. Vision.To create a world that is healthier and more just for all and where everyone can live life to their full potential. Mission.The mission of DSPH is to provide education, conduct research, and partner with communities and organizations to improve the health of populations. We view health as a human right and have a special commitment to improving health in cities, eliminating health disparities, and promoting health in all policies.

Kline School of Lawwas established in 2006, building on the existing strengths of Drexel University in areas including experiential education and the fields of engineering, science, business, and health care. Undergraduate courses offered through Kline School of Law provide students with a strong grounding in legal doctrine: helping them understand how laws and regulations are made, interpreted, and applied in legislatures, courthouses, administrative agencies, and communities. At the same time, we believe that law cannot be fully understood by studying doctrine alone or in the abstract. Our law courses are infused with multidisciplinary perspectives that help students develop a deeper, more critical understanding of the role law plays in our society and our world, and our programs are designed to be flexible so students can combine the study of law with a more traditional academic discipline. The undergraduate study of law will help prepare students for employment and graduate education in areas from health care to human resources, and from social services to digital media: any field where familiarity with legal systems, processes, and regulations are a significant advantage. Students will gain both important theoretical grounding in law and legal theory along with a distinctly practical understanding of how statutes and laws regulate a variety of individual, societal, and institutional choices.",

        "description": "The Dornsife School of Public Health (DSPH) was founded on the principle of health as a human right and the recognition of the importance of social justice as a means to achieve health for all. We define health broadly to encompass physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely as the absence of disease or infirmity. We view the focus on the health of populations as a distinguishing feature of the field of public health. Our focus on population health requires us to consider not only the characteristics of individuals but also the broader social, economic, and policy contexts of health. It also implies that a broad range of actions and policies beyond those of the health care system can substantially impact health. Improving population health requires a fundamental commitment to social justice and the elimination of inequities in health. The goal of improving population health also cannot be achieved without meaningful and sustained partnerships. DSPH is committed to providing rigorous evidence and training, to building equitable partnerships, and to translating knowledge into actions that improve population health and reduce health inequities. Special distinguishing features of DSPH include a commitment to social justice and health equity, and engaging with local and global partners to create meaningful change via policy and public health practice. Vision.To create a world that is healthier and more just for all and where everyone can live life to their full potential. Mission.The mission of DSPH is to provide education, conduct research, and partner with communities and organizations to improve the health of populations. We view health as a human right and have a special commitment to improving health in cities, eliminating health disparities, and promoting health in all policies. Values.DSPH faculty, staff, and students are committed to the following:",
